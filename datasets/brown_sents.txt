dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner he certainly didnt want a wife who was fickle as ann 
sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back to sleep his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing 
the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake 
each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years 
he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows he had no idea how much time budd would give him 
he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle 
no one walked in this country least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled 
he cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his winchester and started downstream his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house 
reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his winchester in his hands they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty 
she lay there making no effort to get back on her feet the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring 
he didnt think it was possible for this couple to be pretending he asked could we have a drink 
 in the kitchen he said leaning his winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl 
she had reached a point at which she didnt even care how she looked her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry 
it must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding he picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house 
any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him 
he put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table they looked a good deal alike morgan thought 
morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girls head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth she drank greedily and murmured thank you as he lowered her head 
he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove 
 who are you and what happened to you  im billy jones the boy answered 
 what are you doing here  about five miles north of the line 
 you mean you dragged your wife all over hells halfacre looking for work  the town of buckhorns only about six miles from here 
 this is a mighty empty country morgan said  theres only one more ranch three miles north of here 
could you give us a job mr he was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple 
he hadnt shaved for several weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression there was more to this than jones had told him 
 i could use some help morgan said finally but i cant afford to pay you anything i guess youd better go on in the morning 
 ive been mucking in a mine in the san juan but i used to work on a ranch  right now you need a meal and a bath 
morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table when the meal was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl 
she rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair  im a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed 
i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said 
do you take in all the strays who come by  i dont have many strays coming to my front door he said 
she got to her feet staggered and almost fell he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen 
im usually a very strong woman but im awfully tired its not much of a meal but its what i eat 
 mr morgan its the bestlooking food i ever saw he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much 
the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself when he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldnt send them on 
 were not drunkards she said she helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark 
he said youll feel a lot better after you have a bath your feet are in bad shape mrs jones 
 no shell be all right jones said quickly  i mean we dont have any way to get there and we cant expect you to quit work just to take us to town 
 my dress needs some work on it he nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors 
he nodded at the door in front of him the bed isnt made but youll find plenty of blankets there 
 well pay you back if youll let us  its all right he said 
he said if its all right with you mr morgan ill sleep out here on the couch i just cant take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together 
 we got fired jones said they were a pair of lost whipped kids morgan thought as he went to bed 
gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide 
beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known 
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless gavins lips moved so that clayton had to stoop to catch the words 
 he stuck with me all these years just a halfbreed pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with me 
it was a fair fight the boy provoked it big charlie told me so they killed big charlie dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago 
 do you mean he asked almost shyly you want me to go with you wherever youre goin  you dont hate me any more 
the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton went forward to him gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely 
i saw you driftin away but i tried and you wanted no part of me when i had so much to give 
god in heaven i cant refuse you now cant let you go way from me again he closed his eyes ashamed of his tears 
ill saddle the horses and bring them round he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air 
when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch the stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head 
 you take it easy boy clayton whispered you take it easy your time will come 
he had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand the stock bumping on the wood floor clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps 
we may take her with us to california i dont know yet its crazy 
start out fresh the two of us like nothin had ever happened  yes like a father and son 
 i made you so you could stand up  yes gavin you did 
help me up i feel kind of stiff clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child 
 it will grow again in california  i loved this valley he whispered huskily 
it was nice then so peaceful and quiet clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallions rump 
they rode at a measured pace through the valley dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest 
it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moons wind a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be broken by the will of men in that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind 
in vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life the silence oppressed him made him bend low over the horses neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search 
then at last the darkness began to dissolve a bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky 
they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence 
they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated of purpose lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire 
thats what you wanted isnt it clayton is with him takin him out of the valley 
 hes not your brother hes gavins son you see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone 
he remembered gavins smirk his own cringing feeling his impotence then he thought of a time when claytons horse had fallen lame in the gap 
he wouldnt even dance with her at gavins party and you stand by like a fool and let him do it 
it was the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game  youre gavins son joe purvis had said 
he meant to help gavin all the time he made a fool of you lester 
there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place if we let them go they wont stay away theyll find men to ride with them and theyll be back 
 he killed tom do you understand that cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night 
purvis and silas pettigrew were the last to leave they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance 
the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line 
the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavins stallion he looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers 
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north he knew who was riding after him the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn their loyalty to him 
the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in his valley with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again 
he was too old when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead he was passing from life he was in fact showing signs of reviving 
he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat mike stripped these from him and donned them 
fiske joined them unsteady on his feet julia seeing the bandage rushed to him 
he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek  thank you my dear he said 
 well grab horses dean said  the main bunch is outside but there are some over there inside the wall 
but it at least offered him a chance for living and for the sake of julia and susan it had to be tried 
no doubt there would be men guarding the horses about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade as best mike could make out in the moonlight 
 dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said all of you be ready to ride hell for leather 
he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol she clung to him talking to him and dabbing at her eyes 
dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms he kissed her also and with deep tenderness 
 running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her 
and using him mike mclish as a sop to her pride he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol 
 im going to walk up to the horses bold as brass pretending im one of the guerrillas theres bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close 
it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses 
 is that you bill the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight 
mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol but the luck that had been running their way left him 
he tried to veer the rifle around to fire into mikes body mike off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded 
this time it connected solidly on the mans temple felling him the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills 
 no but the fats in the fire  theres no chance now of all of us getting away 
mike took the bayonet from deans hand and slashed the picket line dean resisted mikes attempt to push him toward the horse 
youre the one thats taking the big chance dean still hesitated but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand 
 favor him and save something in case you hit trouble watch out for apaches when it comes daylight 
ill stampede the rest of these horses so they cant chase you dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back 
then he was on his way at a gallop mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes with the bayonet 
these poured through the gate and joined the flight the animals thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges 
he scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings his shout had been taken up and repeated 
all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were halfclad or hardly clad at all durkin and calhoun came running from the post 
they followed the others toward the east gate beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches 
he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to mikes left but he too suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade 
a lantern hung from a peg giving light ducking inside he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner 
an ammunition case stood open containing canisters which contained powder cartridges mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty 
his looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas he looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons struck by a new inspiration 
he picked up the powder canister and ran out bursting paper cartridges he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it 
he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him 
its force spun him around but he recovered and got into stride again a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety 
susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them the three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap 
she crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal chewing into the planks some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak 
mike rolled to susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet he hovered over her to shield her for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls 
mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired he dropped a man with the first bullet 
the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem 
 get a bucket line going the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring 
many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort the roof of the command post began to buckle 
 run em right into the spring one of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame 
the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings the glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows giving light enough to examine mikes wound 
but it had missed the bone and had passed on through susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury 
 so it wasnt the earthquake that made him return to his village now dammit i dont want to go into any more explanations 
 dirion found a large war party south of us theyll probably attack at dawn montero said 
using his hands as a trumpet he shouted fort up theres a large war party on their way 
then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal  that was a terrible thing to do i said to oso 
god what a world you people live in  old knifes got the largest war party ever seen on the river he said calmly 
let old knife come up and kill you and your people or would you steer him on someone else  mr manuel did that in the war 
mr manuel whispered in the ears of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin to raid em for their horses then he went on to the cheyennes and told them that the sioux was goin to move up 
the war department wrote mr manuel a letter and said he was a hero he carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin 
in this country theres a war on every time the grass turns green first it was the nations against themselves then it was them against the whites 
i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight once we get over the mountains others will come along 
 old knifes not the only chief hell get to do his dirty work before we get through hell have the blackfeet hankerin for our hair and our goods 
as i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection i grudgingly found myself agreeing with osos logic especially when i imagined what would have happened to missy if old knifes large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company for unlike the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet 
still i was disgusted with myself for agreeing with monteros methods surprisingly he had told the others what he had done 
 i think montero did right amy said firmly  it was a terrible thing to do 
gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky our camp was in the center of a wide valley 
he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire the pony herd was the one flaw in our defense 
wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors the cooks had prepared one of the best meals wed had in a long time and on monteros orders had baked enough bread to last the day 
the worst part had been the waiting although we didnt expect the attack before dawn the long cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed endless 
oso slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms every time i closed my eyes i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife 
they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spinechilling scalp cry  oso montero called ill get gray eyes 
 hold your fire montero was shouting ill shoot the first man who doesnt 
his face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest 
his mouth was open his neck corded with the strain of his screams my god how long is he going to wait i thought 
as he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony 
he started to run but osos shot caught him on the wing he jerked once in the grass and lay still 
what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled and retreated 
out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and wounded and dead horses the morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of newspilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses and the bitterness of burned powder 
one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek his legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him 
 for christs sake dont waste your powder on one of em the charge i tell you 
they grew louder as the indians charged again i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open shouting their spinechilling cries 
the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat i could see the blood running down his chest 
in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger monteros shot had caught him high in the chest 
the horses were only several lengths away when he fired the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse 
i heard the whir of an ax and a canadians face burst apart in a bloody spray i saw little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indians face became shattered flesh and bone 
oso reached up jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck other indians were running at the ponies shrilling and waving blankets 
i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again 
a small indian dived at montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt it sounded like a man kicking a melon 
although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil 
coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil now under me i could see him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint 
others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under the slashing hoofs some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts 
she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist  i saw your fire she said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger 
it wouldnt matter to a fool like you  all right wilson said quickly 
 im not advising you she said and make sure its out when you leave in the morning 
 theres some mistake he said finally its bigger than it has to be though i dont see where its doing any harm 
she showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight 
she said and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly  from a man in st louis wilson said 
he stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him 
its not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of i have it with me right here 
 it wouldnt matter to my father and not to me i meant what i said about that fire 
it was meant to insult him and didnt quite succeed he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now 
somebody might mistake you for a woman he meant to say more but he never got the chance 
she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle she came down against him and he tried to break her fall 
it made him a little sick and he let go of her he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her 
he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps  that quirt i ought to use it on you where it would do the most good 
the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and wilson had a good look at him 
and he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek  shes not a man mister he said 
 put the rifle down joseph the girl said  i thought i told you to stay home 
the scar looked pure white in the halfdarkness his eyes were black and deepset and expressionless 
the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him but the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry 
they could hear the ponys feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out  he works for my father the girl said and then seemed to change her mind 
 i guess ill find out soon enough it must have got there when you fell against me 
 ill bet thats as close as youve been to a man since you were a baby wilson said he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist 
i dont know what goes on around here and i dont care i dont know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business and i dont care about that either 
she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker he sidestepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding 
her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before he had forgotten that she was so pretty 
he had known women like that one woman in particular he watched the girl until she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldnt hear the sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were sleeping 
he hadnt shown up too well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman they expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed 
 go to sleep he said theres better things to do than listen to something like that 
he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it 
if she did he could stand it better in the light he scrubbed absentmindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out 
already some of the pain had gone from amelias death there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief 
the land wasnt all wilson had expected of it six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis had said 
the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard livable perhaps but badly in need of repairs 
the place had been cheap just the little he had left after amelias burial and it would serve its purpose there was only one place where jake carwoods description had gone badly awry the peace and quiet 
they had the house cleaned up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him 
wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they werent going to town at all that girl last night what was her name 
he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made it seem 
there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble 
the first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley it was hotter once they reached the flat and drier but the grass was better 
a redtailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of kelseyville 
such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all 
it was dark and i sensed very large only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it 
i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most 
this impressed me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence his job simply consisted in registering new men 
none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him he spoke to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belied his personality 
it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was but it was not easy for him and he often slipped 
i felt certain he was really a spineless little man his hat the cause of his baldness 
the mornings tabloids were on the counter and a stack of dogeared mens magazines on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music 
noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air 
he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence then bark into it with gruff importance 
in the mornings i was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office 
i was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand 
each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket 
when suitably lighted what would it look like the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air 
by counting the number of stalls and urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended 
i had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not tell 
this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder 
and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently it sprang from a type of mentality id encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here 
i felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance i lived in a state of suspense because of it 
i had signed it off on the forms my future lay solely with the hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point 
i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall 
large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it 
the sounds issuing from beyond winches whirring men shouting indicated great activity and excited me the hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons 
i kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it 
i returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk as i had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application 
when i asked him what if anything i could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten oclock 
when i went for my interview with the director i saw why although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people 
i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men 
past it i could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor i was at once disappointed although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained 
he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and greentinted soft collar they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment 
i had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall 
begging my pardon he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there 
was i sure he asked that i knew what i was applying for what sort of men i would come into contact with at the hall 
though i doubted that he would understand me i told the director my motives for applying i had always i said hankered after working hard with my hands 
to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head 
the man went over without sound falling to the bare floor barton said harshly why did you do that 
barton caught the lighter mans shoulder and swung him around  lets get one thing straight you and me 
if you ever try anything without my orders ill kill you it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the thinlipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now 
there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks they moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall 
two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed they looked up in surprise as powers came in 
 its curtiss he said naming the man rankin had hit the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet 
as he passed through it barton shoved his gun against the mans side the man halfreached for the cord of the alarm bell 
they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts 
they walked the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts 
he had been one of the original night riders one who had escaped the trial it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on dills release from the prison 
kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers 
he said in a studied voice i didnt do it for you youre the only man the night riders will follow 
barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse  meaning you want me to ride out 
he did not trust rankin his violent temper his killer instinct but ten years in prison had taught him realities 
it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side 
 bury those uniforms so they wont be found then barton touched carl dills arm and moved off up the river bank 
they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco 
through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly for his first five years in prison they had shared a cell 
he had been the auditor for the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicates money the one thing they had in common was their hatred 
he said now ive got the perfect headquarters set up twenty years before a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley 
then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned  the roads washed badly said dill but theres a trail you can get over with a horse 
 how do the valley people feel but krugers men keep them off balance and they dont trust me 
barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind dill was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension 
after another long pause he asked how many people know who they are hes informed them of everything youve ever written him 
 but you cant ride into the ferry i understand how you feel about the child 
my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away donald kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage and i wouldnt entrust a snake to his tender care 
it was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame 
it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence 
the office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove the building was dwarfed by the scene outside 
the gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices 
their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums 
fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt ten years older than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation 
he lived and breathed for the mining company no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life 
the man was tall thin with a narrow face and a toolarge nose the eyes always held hague eyes of a dead man lidless as a lizards with the fixed intensity of a cobra 
kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger kodyke was to head the dread company police 
he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype we want him back there or we want him dead 
you know how the ranchers in the valley are ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches 
we dont want bartons night riders loose again the gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing 
if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it after they had finished eating melissa took sprite the kitten under her arm so that auntie grace can teach it about the whistle and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother 
when they reached their neighbors house pamela said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought of the type to which she was frequently subject these days that they might never see one another again then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination 
so simple in fact that it might even work although pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend too much assurance that mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her 
when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped all of her movements were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime 
here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom on her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving an object which pamela believed now had been the property of her greatgrandfather major hiram munroe culver 
if she pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation she would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into the soil every spring or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice 
there was only one place where the mountain might receive her that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin 
perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream but she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never awaken 
she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it the forest was open and freely welcoming extending an enchanted hand 
birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun all dewyeyed and soft caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all 
perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed was it not possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the culvers that she had erred in failing to understand this 
the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants 
a few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous today on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable 
she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal if as she walked her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen 
she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes 
red man or white man pacifist or killer the forest would accept them all knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man 
if when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent 
his bright daylight mind would whistle away such images they would not dare to face his scoffing 
the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles the trees huddled more closely together their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun 
she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles the forest had become an alien world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrances were offered 
at one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry silence came into the forest a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees 
silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her blocking her retreat she stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth 
for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet laboriously she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes 
she seemed to have come such a long distance too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees she stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her 
the earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the suns rays she had the feeling that under the mouldering leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain 
there was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene 
it enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles it crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin 
it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached 
clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws she had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her of reason and sight 
the shadows of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the grove she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in evertightening circles 
she had to move in some direction any direction that would take her away from this evil place she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back 
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her 
she began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him  i want to tell you something thomas demontez lord 
 but it dont matter atall lord supplied fondly  to me youll always be the girl o my dreams an the sweetest flower that grows 
ive got something to say to you and by god youre going to listen he said he wanted very much to listen 
so would she mind speaking a little louder  i think you stink tom lord 
so i can hear you while im checkin the car looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble 
wasnt you goin to say somethin then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence maybe you could write it down for me huh 
 aah go on she said he grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car 
then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring he went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination 
he wore no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country never hed once told joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun 
thats really all hes got all he is just a big pile of selfconfidence in an almost teensy package 
against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis here in the godforsaken place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible 
but shed known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there left he could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more wiry than truly strong 
just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone but by gosh i want him and im going to have him 
why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years he slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her 
 cant you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute  this aint your brand maybe lord suggested 
 i feel like getting back to town thats what i feel like now are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk 
on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldnt either i figger its probly a sixtyfivemile walk and i cn maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours 
 not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon ill get the boss rattler to help me she saw it then the distant derrick of the wildcat a test well in unexplored country 
sufficiently at least to get them back into town a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency 
 well lets get going she said impatiently  i she broke off frowning 
getting the boss rattlesnake to help you  why i meant what i said lord declared 
then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her makeup in his mood it was the best way to handle him 
otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum teased and provoked until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood the car lurched along at a snails crawl the leftfront mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself 
he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned along with this selfsatisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension 
joyce had seen him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion that was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride field boss for the highlands oil & gas company 
mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip he had a legitimate reason for wearing it 
moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriffs office had made no previous issue of it  so whats this all about 
by failing to do as he was told instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he had played into lords hands the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest 
so how about it  why single me out on this permit deal 
 we aim t be seelective yknow dont like to bother no one unless we have to which i figger we do in your case 
he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him he was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable 
 i know youve got a grudge against me and maybe i cant blame you you think that highlands swindled you and i helped em do it 
an that could mean trouble with a fella thats workin for crooks so you get rid of that pistol right now mister mcbride 
not without a facesaving respite of at least a few minutes to do so would make his job wellnigh impossible 
 ill get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately  just as soon as i go to the bank and 
it was strictly the deputys game but mcbride had gone too far to throw in now he could only play the last card in what was probably the worlds coldest deck 
it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own volition lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine 
and then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gutflattening blow to the stomachno more could he defend himself against them 
and he could no longer think of facesaving of honor but only of escape why hes going to kill me he thought wildly 
beat me to death in front of a hundred people somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished 
mcbride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust fearmaddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again 
dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly he could not grasp that lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air 
this he was sure was the way they would act laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death 
she lived by the rules never compromising never blinded or diverted by circumstance when he regained consciousness he was in lords house in the office of doctor lord the deputys deceased father 
the herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first nights bedground two of the new hands a mexican named jose amado and a kid known only as laredo were picked for the first trick of riding night herd 
they got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosies fire rolled and lighted brownpaper cigarettes lounged about there was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the days drive 
the cook mateo garcia had arrived there long before the herd hed started a fire and put coffee on and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon 
the maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby billie had unhitched the mules from both tom brannons and his fathers wagon 
conchita kept an eye on the twins and little elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon 
hed come alone without his wife and child hed been in an angry mood conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him 
she wished that she could talk to her mother about it not that her mother knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it 
 pat get out of that creek elena youll get mud all over your dress 
tomas she called him as the mexican hands did he was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero luis hernandez 
certainly she wouldnt dare ask her father afterward he would tell her not to pry into grownups affairs as though she were a little kid like elena 
they were sitting on their heels riderfashion over by the still empty calf wagon brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him 
hed told hank maguire and luis hernandez about his wifes refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do they were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned 
let senora brannon live in her fathers house for a time after all you want the senora as much as you want the boy 
 she wont change her mind brannon said  john clayton will see to that 
 in a year shell like living in claytons house too much to come back to me brannon said flatly  and the boy will be too much under his influence by then 
hell in a year or five or ten the boy will have forgotten me his own father  but to take him and leave his mother behind is not good 
 that i cant answer for i cant imagine something like this happening to me maybe i should withdraw my advice no 
like luis i cant see something like this happening to me with maria and me theres never any problem 
if you take the one youd better take both  i wont force beth to come against her will 
they were silent for a little while each looking glum finally luis hernandez said what must be must be 
and hank maguire added so am i tom  all right brannon said rising 
brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall they had for cover both darkness and a summer storm 
later theyd heard the rumble of thunder and then just outside rockfork they ran into rain the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles 
it was to be nothing more than that if the bluff failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they would withdraw and he would come after his son another time 
with him were hank maguire luis hernandez and luiss son pedro the seventh man was red hogan a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hellraising 
also because of the storm the streets of rockfork were deserted they reined in before the town marshals office a boxsized building on main street 
 probably just stepped out he said with red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe 
 not there he said getting back onto his horse they rode to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of the street 
hed put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked he was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain 
hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal  hes finished eating hogan said 
it seemed long at least to tom brannon he and hogan waited by the door one to either side 
he was puffing on a cigar and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain it was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late 
 just come along brannon told him  dont start anything you cant finish 
 well talk over at your office  brannon i warn you 
they escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office the other five slashb men followed them inside crowding the small room 
he looked at each of them in turn brannon last of all  ill remember you he said 
 now hold on damn it he lifted the skirt of macklins coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk 
 dont press your luck badgetoter brannon said now the key to the lockup marshal 
brannon youve assaulted a law officer and they moved in on him crowded him from all sides 
his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing he held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure 
 get it out brannon ordered then as macklin obeyed now lets go out back 
they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron 
they crowded him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in once the door was open they crowded him inside the dark building 
they returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on houston street deputy marshal luke harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark 
 dont try it brannon told him dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following  dont get yourself killed for something that doesnt concern you 
miguel and arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering they trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and toughlooking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house 
they tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet their presence fouled the elegance of that room 
the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be allknowing for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second 
for with a single exception nothing had happened to them the exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis 
a split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded hed mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which hed estimated the shot had come 
there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near lewis was a man who had made a fulltime job of cow stealing 
he had done his rustling openly and boasted about it he had received both first and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them 
he was a man those neighbors testified later who didnt have a friend in the world william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone 
he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious faroff shot then spent most of the day searching out the area 
 just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin coward facetoface for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time 
he slumped against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and huddled on the ground 
rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning he was finally found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties away 
for tom horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a tenday drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends 
 three shots in that fella fore he hit the ground you reckon theres two men in this state can shoot like that 
for a bloodchilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job hed promised to do tom horn was soon back at work giving his secret employers their moneys worth 
the company herds were being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted but there were other homesteaders who passed the lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his neighbors 
even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still disappearing for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on a blatant and defiant rustler named fred powell 
 everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didnt care who knew it even after them notes came even after hed heard about lewis even after hed been shot at a couple o times hisself on the morning of september ## #### powell and ross rose at dawn and began their days work 
harnessing a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willowlined creek about a halfmile off then climbed down and began chopping andy ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded 
the hired man ran over to help his boss  my god im shot 
he heaved the dead man onto the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing 
there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots not even an empty cartridge case could be found 
once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready later riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made 
 and i sort o got a corner on the market  tom a friend asked him once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers 
he had lots of friends then as always even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend 
 well he explained sposin you was a nester swingin the long rope which would you be most scairt of a drygulchin or a shootdown 
 but well it just dont seem sportin somehow  i seen a lot o things in my time 
i heard o texas cattlemen wrappin a cow thief up in green hides and lettin the sun shrink em and squeeze him to death but theres one thing i never seen or heard of one thing i just dont think there is and thats a sportin way o killin a man 
when fred powells brotherinlaw charlie keane moved into the dead mans home the anonymous letter writer took no chances on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice if you dont leave this country within # days your life will be taken the same as powells was 
all through albany and laramie counties other men were doing the same houses of settlers whod treated the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards 
no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated 
it is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him 
 the best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about $### very good money in an era when top hands worked for $## and found  rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victims head as a sort of trademark 
one thing was certain his method was effective so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week 
he evidently couldnt foresee that it might be his downfall in the end he had made himself the personification of the devil to the homesteaders 
such ranchers as coble and clay and the bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown he made their spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups 
the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was threatening a beloved way of life the wailing guitarstrumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him 
when several minutes had passed and curt hadnt emerged from the livery stable brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across the counter  i have a little job for you charlie 
brenners voice was oily but summers wasnt fooled  what is it you want me to do mr brenner 
tell her to come here to the hotel vastly relieved summers nodded and started toward the door 
tell her curt adams wants to see her summers pulled up short and turned around 
 it doesnt seem quite right telling her a thing like that couldnt i just his voice trailed off into silence 
he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadnt before noticed  you know summers he said thoughtfully 
if someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a haystack he started toward the stairway then turned to add tell her to come to adamss room that adams is in trouble 
curts visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching he paused only long enough to ascertain that jesss buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside 
a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding 
curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees there was a light in blacks front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior 
he could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else there was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened 
again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition 
he found a match in his pocket and lit it there were two horses in the barn a swaybacked dun and jess crouchs buckskin 
curt wanted to get jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved 
the startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall as curt had hoped the house door banged open 
curt moved over beside the door and waited presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard and jesss smothered curses 
curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance in its owners voice jess cursed again and entered the barn 
as he crossed to the side of the stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer  before you try anything he said 
 thats the stuff curt said he reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt 
he moved up and lifted jesss pistol out of its holster  damn you adams jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock 
if i dont come back in the house breeds going to  your triggerhappy brother isnt in the house 
now turn around so i can see your face there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen 
i dont know what youre up to but when brenner  you can forget about brenner too curt said 
 i dont know nothin about him i suppose you dont know anything about a piece of twobyfour either 
curts fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun  so help me crouch id like to kill you where you stand but before i do im going to hear you admit killing him 
he drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across jesss face but didnt finish the motion pistolwhipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like jess but curt couldnt bring himself to do it 
 having all the guns makes you a big man dont it adams if we was both armed you wouldnt talk so tough 
he retreated a step and holstered his own the fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw but he didnt reach for the gun 
 does this make it any easier coward  i aint drawin against you jess said thickly 
i just wanted to hear you say so jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides 
somewhere in the distance a woman screamed curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention 
once more he lifted jesss gun from its holster only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin  well do it another way then he said harshly 
with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack curt managed to duck beneath the mans flailing fist and drove home a solid left to jesss midsection 
pain shot up curts arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning 
as it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move when his eyes began to focus he saw jess charging at him with a pitchfork 
jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose it gave curt time to stagger to his feet 
he stepped inside jesss guard and landed two blows to the big mans belly putting everything he had behind them when his head came down curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall 
even blacks old crowbait began to snort and from the house black yelled jess he lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall 
blood gushed from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curts fists curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldnt quit 
you killed him didnt you  it was brenners idea jess mumbled dabbing at his nose 
he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble  you mean anyone who stood up for his rights curt said 
turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached over to untie the buckskins halter rope and waved his hand in the animals face curt moved in and picked up his gun 
leaving jesss where it lay he left the stall jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door 
 youre staying right here for a while im going to let him tell it to somebody else 
youre coming along peacefully or ill put a bullet in your leg curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it 
maybe if the marshal hears this himself itll make a difference somebody in this town must still have some backbone 
 soon as we send them on their way and make camp lets you and me go for a walk down by the snake all by ourselves  sally admonished her mother youve got all evening to visit with dan 
what a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap 
dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen so long as sallys pa was coming out best on the haggle dan didnt feel the need of putting in his twobits worth 
there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve 
he stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully from the way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal 
the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him 
nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice he moved in close jerked the handsome broadbrimmed beaver hat from nates head and clamped it on his own 
 me and yous trading hats sos youll have something permanent to remember me by sally left her choring to stand beside dan 
much as they had to look forward to they didnt begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go at first matilda could not believe her own eyes 
and now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front of their trailworn wagon seeing them waiting there at the foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them matilda could not speak at all 
hez asked who still believed theyd have them to lick  they aint even in sight 
soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again but even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day 
then and only then with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the harrows take time to catch up on the news no sooner did they hear of dans injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action 
from then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food even sally in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag 
only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration but with bill oconnor on the fiddle and gran harrow exuberantly shouting glory be and hallelujah above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration 
 nor methodists neither she replied  not that it matters to me being this far along 
 come spring youll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal at these words of sympathy and understanding harmony said generously i dont mind setting here along with gran while you go out and join in the games 
he looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers  dont reckon theres nobody out there cept maybe dan who can outgrip me harmony 
and she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heighho the dairyoh the farmer in the dell at the sight of sallys happy face and carefree expression harmonys dark brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears 
and she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped theyd be just as right as they now were for her and for rod not with the memory of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close 
with a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed sally out of the circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their outfit soon the child the dog the cat and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle 
no matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness 
soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep 
even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load 
rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins  shucks gran they said almost in unison 
leaning forward in her chair gran nearsightedly scrutinized dans face  hows sally like rubbin agin that thar little ticklebrush yere araising 
gran peered again at the weekold blond mustache shadowing dans upper lip  but honesttobetsy ive seed more hair than that on a piece o bacon 
dan asked hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notchedstick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends  my right legs stiff as a board this morning he replied 
the three men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens signal hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock official signboard for the raft river turnoff and gloated seems funny that them burnsides never took time to leave their johnhenry up thar 
 from now on sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and rods outfit  aint no sense you eating our dust rod protested 
 jackson recruited his critters and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up hes got the tightest running gear in the train now 
captain clemens signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams  reckon yere right dan hez called back over his shoulder 
rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipicewalled gorge  well double teams zigzagging up the mountain harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched look around her mouth 
out of the corner of his eye he could see his fathers wheels beginning to turn before harmony had a chance to reply rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxens backs 
men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them 
there were no less than six or seven saloons in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters  take one side of the street and ill take the other he proposed 
separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero 
he tramped out of the miners rest with his hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street the palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch 
russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch the front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior 
nerves tight as a bowstring he paused to gather his wits against all expectation carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him 
reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he feverishly scanned the busy street below muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down 
 hes there he got out tersely curbing his rising excitement hitching his cartridge belt around pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side 
forced behind him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday 
two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleekheaded bartender absently polished a glass looking the setup over stevens started coolly for the rear of the place 
he did not reply going on toward the back less assured than the tall wideshouldered man in the lead cobb followed alertly a hand on his gun butt 
a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side 
a single kick made it spring open shuddering pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a halffilled bottle upraised as if to strike 
but he was more than halfdrunk and his faculties were dulled cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan 
russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach kneeling cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned 
 go through his pockets will you if we have to well take him apart and see what hes made of 
cobb watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly rose and lunged toward carmers hat which had tumbled halfadozen feet away when he first fell 
inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency carmers ingenious cache for his loot had been found 
 that is if we can be sure this is colcords money  where else would he get it 
 its within a hundred of what crip had he declared  we know penny spent some and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on 
 shall we get out of here leaving the card room they moved back through the palace the way they had come 
pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out he and cobb clattered down the high steps to the street 
itll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord and tell him about it russ to his faint surprise russ held up his hand 
it was you that tracked it down anyway stevens he pursued strictly pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his brows puckered 
 old crip wasnt retorted cobb tartly but i want this to sink in awhile 
 pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs  youre the doctor he returned with a smile 
 you dont have to tell me flashed cobb giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street 
at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for antler the truth was the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck 
yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck stobers part in recent events 
 its the second time war ax hands made a play for that money how much of an accident could that be 
in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot but on the range gunfire had a meaning 
as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the antler ranch house so far as he knew only his father could be there 
his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing still a quartermile away the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed 
when it was followed by a second whining even closer cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression he knew now what he was up against 
cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly if he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later 
a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side the wouldbe assassin had his position figured pretty close 
leading his pony he hurried that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range swinging up then and bending forward over the horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw 
he had been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot 
a second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw 
sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment he heard cries from behind him but he could make out no words 
recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range 
early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat record 
cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan anything the enemy flew or floated was his target 
greg himself took two flights with todman leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around ormoc on the east coast of leyte a weapons carrier took greg todman belton banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip 
there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle 
his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before 
 ive got her as neat as i can donovan said as he dropped the straps of the seton harness over gregs shoulders dont you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself believed it 
the expression was his trademark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out 
he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission yet long before the scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky 
the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful the control tower gave him immediate takeoff permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan 
to the west the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray 
the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it he possessed the fighter pilots horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory 
they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar and hope that it didnt close in before they returned greg pushed the radio button on his throttle 
stay in close and well go up the valley  roger sweeney todman called back and pulled his four in and slightly above greg 
he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundredandeightydegree turn 
the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in if the other pilots were worried they did not show it 
he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity 
 somebody beat us to it todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation 
his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill 
finally as time began to run out he headed into ormoc and glidebombed a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run 
only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle with their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily 
like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley he was about to make a gas check on his flight when todmans voice broke in sweeneys 
he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast they were headed straight for each other on a collision course 
and then he thought todman might be right his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification 
if it were the enemy tactically his position was correct japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability american on speed and firepower 
but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was the enemy and he hadnt been spotted already but the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course 
greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two rogers the planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully 
greg wished the air corps had continued to camouflage planes there was of course no way for the other planes to get by them 
 todman drop your second element back if any of us miss they can pick up the pieces 
the shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight 
theyre japs came a highpitched voice he moved the flights over against one wall 
if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done 
the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around  they havent seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise 
out of the corner of his eye he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done 
please dear god make my pilots good he prayed he took a lead on the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another 
six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them 
his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane it was all greg had time to see 
if he spun out now he would join his opponent on the ground he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back 
he held the controls where they had been sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip 
over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles cool air moving slowly through the open or smashedout side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat 
we were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican moriarty new mexico 
i waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass then i saw the fathers head slightly turn 
whiteshirted and conservativelycravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze suddenly a treble auto horn tootleytoottootled and thumbing hopefully i saw emergent in windshield flash red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair the leering face of old herry 
over the rapidlydiminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage herrys black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where hidden more delicatelytextured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes i would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and well at least i wouldnt have shouted back a taunt 
just as i straightened up with my duffel bag i heard sahjunt yoorick meet mrs major j a roebuck the voice was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew 
 onleh one thiihng mrs roebuck continued  ahm goin nawth tjawn mah husbun in sante fe an yall maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt 
i said that it didnt make any difference to me either as far as i knew how far i knew will shortly become apparent 
i let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the ## mph which would i hoped overhaul herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had i mrs major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in sante fe when johnson ejaculated howsabout my buying us all a nice cold cocola maam 
johnson never would have believed she had a son that age mrs roebuck thought johnson was a sweet bawh tlah lahk thet but her herman was getting to be a man there was no getting around it 
just as plite an an cohnfidunt an ah says uh coahse you caint but he says whah nawt you ah hevin one an ah coudn ansuh him an so ah said aw right ah gayess an his fathuh didn uttuh one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink tgethuh fovuh a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn mah back an ah doan think thets nahce at all dyou 
 im a good baptist and drinking mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico 
hardly had mrs roebuck driven off when a rusty pickup truck father or grandfather of senor moriartys ford sedan came screeching to a dustswirling stop and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back 
 in back buddy the driver said to me quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low siderack i stepped on the running board 
i seized the rack and made a westernstyle flyingmount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag and merely wrecking my camera i was to discover later my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and but this is no medical report i was again in motion and at a speed which belied the trucks similarity to senor xs ford turtle 
i drew back drawing back my foot for a kick but it was only johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cabs glassless rear window 
 hell yes i roared back between dusty lips gracias i hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary 
johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it white teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of his bottle against johnsons ear 
i ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards we were in a field in a tight screeching turn 
when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering just as i got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously 
i regained my squatting position behind the truck cabs rear window johnsons left hand was pressed against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers 
you thought i was a mexican didnt you buddy  hell thats all right buddy the indian i now guessed said 
no sooner had i started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truck teeth again flashing back at me the driver released a deluge of spanish in which amigo appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound 
suddenly the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnsons quivering ribs a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning 
the car was just about to us its drivers fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in sante fe on anything but an old pickup truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the cars steel roof 
the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief probably only a fraction of johnsons the bottle this time went to the indians lips another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill 
in the ditch sand was white and softlooking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming but johnson couldnt quickly unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer 
with more time i could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin suddenly and not a second too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket 
i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile there was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash 
i heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me looking back i saw a grayhaired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number 
two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing the indians arm whipped sidewise there was a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car 
this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the cars rear window 
i quickly turned around and began to drink but the indian was jabbing another bottle toward johnson 
she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes big and dark a melting golden brown 
plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them it was a disturbingly familiar face too but i couldnt remember where we had met 
 no i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all i could think of was this time she stopped the rush of words herself  but one word at a time ok 
would you like a drink or coffee she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a highpitched scream and i let out a lowpitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out 
there had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out and now i was certain id seen her somewhere before  thats what started all the trouble in the first place 
 you may have seen me on tv she said  ive done several filmed commercials for 
man you rang it was in color too miss and miss it was fun for me all right 
it wouldnt wouldnt seem fair somehow  i couldnt agree with you more 
zing was the creation of two men louis thor and bill blake partners in zing theyd peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of sx## to their secret formula and the inauguration of a highpowered advertising campaign sales had soared practically into orbit 
my lovely caller joyce holland was her name had previously done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth a super production had been filmed at the home of louis thor the water in thors big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds fashioned of course from zing joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled 
joyce went on when wed finished lou mr thor asked me to stay a little longer he wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said 
and he didnt have any clothes on  did leap into the pool and didnt have anything on 
 you got away didnt you he caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with zing its very slippery you know 
 so i just scooted out of his clutches i swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car 
shed driven around for a while joyce said then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that time shed gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked in front and walked toward the pool while several yards from it still concealed by the shrubbery shed seen two men on her left at the pools edge 
maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i thought he must be dead the man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana 
i was so scared well i just ran to my car and came here  you know who the other man was 
i didnt get a good look at him at all his back was to me and i was so scared it was just somebody in a mans suit but im sure the other one was lou 
she realized id have to notify the police but fervently hoped i could avoid mentioning her name her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a documentarytype show to be sponsored by oatnut grits 
 and i so want the part she said  the commercials have just been for money there hasnt been any real incentive for me to do them but in underwater western eye id have a chance to act 
as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could do but i promised joyce i would mention her name if at all only as a last resort 
there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room  im starting to itch she said 
i was loaded with suds when i ran away and i havent had a chance to wash it off  you might as well wait here while im gone so you can use my shower if youd like 
one of my virtues or vices is a sort of threedimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color  soak as long as you want joyce 
so youll have everything all to yourself doggone  well goodbye i said 
ill be soaking for at least half an hour but suddenly those hothoney eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them 
i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door as i went out i could hear water pouring in the shower 
but the scene was not the quiet calm scene id expected four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars 
i followed a shrubberylined gravel path alongside the house to the pool two uniformed officers a couple of plainclothesmen i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left 
a few yards beyond the group of men a mans nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra lieutenant rawlins one of the plainclothesmen spotted me and said hi shell and walked toward me 
rawlins worked out of central homicide and wed been friends for years a call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine pm and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that ## minutes ago now 
neither of them i understood had been present at the filming session earlier  what were they doing here 
 yeah ive heard more about sx## than space exploration lately that was the new advertising angle something about a lloyds of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient 
i said ok so now only blake knows hows it strike you foul or fair 
the pm might show he drowned instead but thats what the onceoverlightly gives us accident murder suicide take your pick 
too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living this is not so for education offers all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husbands eyes while you are having an affair with his wife 
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick i worked for my uncle an uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild undercurrent of incest who ran one of those antique shops in new orleans vieux carre the old french quarter 
the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting i had a oneroom studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun 
when my uncle offered me a parttime job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted i loved the city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras 
and when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure 
my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything 
they were married over the weekend though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty it was really a may and december combination 
there was something about the contour of her face her smile that was like new orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me her legs were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite 
you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body the true artist is like one of those scientists who from a single bone can reconstruct an animals entire body 
and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store that she impressed me instantly was obvious 
i thought i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks true she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i did not know or much care 
her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired as it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something clicks 
when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my uncle notice it and then i became aware that she too glanced at me surreptitiously 
i dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship when our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of me too 
why she married him i do not know i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me 
perhaps with my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father 
i was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncles indisposition even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a giveaway flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights 
she placed her palms fingers outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune 
i was standing beside her watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bearlike crush 
i heard her murmur wed better lock the door it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch 
 he will not always be indisposed how will we work it out 
ive noticed the way youve been looking at me ever since we met  i guess we both felt it 
even as i said it i realized that an education can be invaluable  i know what we can do i said 
she raised a protesting hand with a startled air  what are you trying to do 
 i dont want to be thrown out and i dont think i will i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting us 
 when i was in college i grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class i dont even remember who wrote it but it was one of those ##th or ##th century poets 
and now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball 
we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake ponchartrain and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead 
when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it  i dont understand she insisted 
 no i chuckled im just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education as we expected on the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at ## in the morning 
i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date 
a few minutes later i saw my uncles car drive up and a womans figure emerge and walk to the corner i must say the figure was well made up 
in one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain in the half darkness i approached cautiously making sure he did not see me 
 you cheap no good twotiming bitch you get a good loyal husband smack 
he had better write a postcard to walter he opened the myth book again and there along the margin next to robert graves imaginative interpretation of the creation of the dactyls from rheas fingertips were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilders address 
the code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined to find out and put to use a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith and that might be good for something 
 squaresville man and all the palazzos are crummy palasts that ought to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind 
five days later on receiving it meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table his hand was large and square and heavily tanned 
his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months he had returned to the pension a week ago 
he was determined to spend an industrious summer merediths fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him sie lacheln die schwarzen hexen 
or more rhythmically the swarthy witches are laughing and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas 
not by the #### sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him 
she was just not able to break the spell  would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of walters marked bars 
so if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money ballet dancer protests tears and take what you want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful 
and when you get off this job tonight well you can gimme something to eat and as a matter of fact nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that munichs early mornings even in summer are laden with dew 
he used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions  her nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes 
this was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised that long night with nicolas and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes 
her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined 
packing a small suitcase informing her husband whom she found in harrys bar that she was taking a train to germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a drink getting on the train all this had only taken her two hours she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens 
 his address walter added is that great foundling home the american express and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband 
his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched 
nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car in his dream he cried slow down for chrissake 
he blew his nose expertly between his fingers he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs 
twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the grafins pension her tears dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities 
but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once  the grafin was partial to the word shall 
shall we allow her not to have a bath actually she is a sad beauty i believe 
when it stopped he began busily typing sitting up in a virtuous way before dinner he shaved for the second time that day 
singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his italian sun tan he flexed his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew selfconscious of splashing as he washed 
he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets she also served as maid when he saw the grafin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table it would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin so startled was he by mary janes beauty 
above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders 
she had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank you for the use of your bath when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control 
veal cutlets oh i couldnt possibly eat all this wine then you were typing poems this afternoon 
like as if it were built of books having opened the windows onto the terrace lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin 
 i think the maids tipple in the afternoon steinhager she whispered steinhager to herself several times memorizing it 
merediths voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium of the ymha poetry center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy 
the husband points the steps out with his flashlight its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night mary jane asked herself if meredith was blushing at this line or was it the fire in the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go on in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face still blind start wincing in obedience to dirty waters counters pots and pans waiting below stairs in her mind 
 oh its that myth about orpheus and what is her name she raised her face and nodded its sweet and very sad 
she confessed she was unhappy he asked was it her husband she began to explain there was this poet in italy he interrupted please dont judge all poets 
kissing her he whispered several times eurydice but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth 
for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson 
dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze 
he commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face 
he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his playedout limbs the burning air dried his sweatsoaked clothes in saltedged patches 
as cheerfully as possible he said well i guess we could all do with a little drink he unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel 
the water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste thank the lord they still had water 
he took a long but carefully controlled draught he replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck 
she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully 
she was like charcoal he thought dark opaque explosive her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal 
and all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not visibly a ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice 
he tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river  we can get it if we dig he said patiently 
 or do you want to see if i can stand fever too  we can boil it he said 
 the tires are rattling on the wheels now there was no valley like this on your map 
 hettie he said as gently as he could were still headed west  maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves 
he had picked out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon it had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out 
she had hated the whole idea before they started actually she had hated him before she ever saw him 
the bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder 
but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper he stared at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands 
 dont try to be noble  they wouldnt have sold me in the first place if thered been food enough to go around 
 they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our own they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just whats inside of them 
 i might have starved but at least i wouldnt be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt his blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead 
the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharplimbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead then he noticed the clouds racing upon them heavy ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills 
he hollered hoarsely hang on he wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm 
 you had better get inside he warned her the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel 
the sixton conestoga began to whip and shake it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence 
and then came the water not rain but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods 
the jetting frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising 
they were engulfed by the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright sunlight 
the water level was higher than their hubs only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored 
now and then the glistening side of a halfswamped object showed as it swept past the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging her shoulders and still trembling 
out of compulsion to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit the soaking will put life back in the wagon too 
she was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting astride an upright branch 
they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend it speared up into the air then sinking back the upjutting branch turned slowly 
bens eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray and crimson then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they needed his 
he let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward 
it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished 
there was not a matchwidth of damp mark to show they were receding he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills that rimmed the valley 
he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen 
he swung toward the front to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate he got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee 
he found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save now he broke them open hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie 
he furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and wagon open he looked thoughtfully at his wifes trunk holding her meager treasures 
she said without turning her head after that rain beating in atop the dust there isnt a thing that wont be streaked he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs 
i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze now roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do 
he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the sharkinfested waters one especially bad detonation shook lifeboat no # which trembled violently in the davits 
we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until they bled profusely the bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare 
brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the boat  lets get away fast said brassnose shaking water from his mop of bleached hair 
then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of blackandorange smoke dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldnt go back into that inferno 
 sommers you bale while we row brassnose commanded as best as i could determine we were some ### miles west of new guinea in the bismark archipelago 
now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands 
he then said something which struck a chord in my memory  god help us if were near the island of eromonga 
i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies  even when the islands were under german mandate before world war # europeans gave eromonga a wide berth 
i remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate bobby pauson but how do they reproduce dr griggs im sure that males have something to do with that process 
of course males play a role there but believe me when i say you wouldnt enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga indeed you wouldnt live long for the females either drive the men theyve seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods 
 i think i know what you mean brassnose i said lets hope we come to a safer place 
foster lukuklu frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs i recognized it as an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil in a voice so frightened as to seem not his own the big bosuns mate quavered 
there was a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump it was perhaps ## feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs 
 what is the scaffolding for brassnose he made a sound of despair deep in his throat 
it is their tultul the jumping platform of death it is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male is worthy of survival there 
they had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft 
but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tonguetied or panicked so i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and said we greet you in peace 
our sore and burned hands and arms need attention the girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me 
she said my name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen you shall have food water and rest 
i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight 
others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me 
the body may have been two or three weeks dead many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh 
as if divining my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden  this is our tultul a jumping platform aku 
it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one  you have every right to be i replied gravely in the manu dialect but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest and strongest of us 
i felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldnt do to show these girls that we were afraid i clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily hoping it would make an impression on the women this one is the maku frayne 
the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather this was the worst thing i could have said 
they despise males who brag of their strength they destroy such men with their damned tests 
at first i thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this but a glance at songau and the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out 
at a nod from songau four lithe and muscular girls darted to fraynes side and seized him by the arms the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle 
besides terror had sapped some of fraynes vitality and will my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face
in the hut to which i was assigned max had his own quarters my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases her name was lturu and she told me many things 
though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women  her account was later confirmed by the scobeefrazier expedition from the university of manitoba in #### 
but in the middle of the last century an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an intertribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled miraculously karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable loss of life on both sides 
she quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death within a decade or less few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up 
she cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betelstained teeth  karipos women then named this place eromonga manhood for just the strongest men could stay here 
in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four figures in a semicircle on the ground  i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized then headed for home 
benson looked up and saw rameys long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack 
somehow the thought of a simple man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened 
maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us anyway he doesnt deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at 
benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble  nope just you all the time sometimes i think its the only way ill ever get a decent partner 
whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think 
 he wasnt in the car ramey said  you didnt go clear around benson said 
 too long a waiting line ramey answered pretending to joke a few minutes later the insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a faraway state 
sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane 
it had always seemed strange to ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist an extruck driver like horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head the insurance man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all right and that he would watch the mens personal effects until they towed the rig back to town 
every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear when they were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer 
she had driven up with her husband in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that she wore shorts and a loose terrycloth shirt 
 what outfit does she drive for seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition 
he had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run the truck routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay 
the feeling subsided it was only a small yearning  whats she doing in this bunch 
her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on 
what had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but benson knew what it was the girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could never decide was real said you dont want to go around there maam 
the man stood near the bent leviclad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car  what does he want a spoon 
with ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was halfoff the indians foot that he would always remember the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top 
the two men in overalls stood just behind the blondeheaded man he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows 
he was very tanned big hands might have torn him from a cocacola poster  hes dead isnt he 
there was nothing in particular on the mans face it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine 
there was a gentle concern in bensons voice ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the mans tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded bloodflecked substance lying by itself on the pavement 
ramey heard the words again inside weakened the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or lightheadedness pressing in his ears the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and rameys vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the mans leg 
he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees dont do that fella the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist 
it was a straight solid onceinalifetime shot he laid all four knuckles in between the mans cheekbone and his chin 
the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand 
he hadnt done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him 
after what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth 
ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him a womans voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from the mans wife 
one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him blood dripped down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color 
 can you hear can you talk to me an incoherent puzzled sound came from the red mouth 
none of the crowd had stepped forward to help then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment 
a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again behind ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers 
ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly 
some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey its all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them 
he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolmans swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol  all right step back 
he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him  mough its my mough the man said trying to talk without moving his lips 
then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute the body continued to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow 
he heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered the snake right on the porch with wood axes it was only then that he turned to look at penny 
the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth shes got more guts than any other woman in the world 
i dont suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but i am and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty 
 i realize that this is hardly the time to say it penny said keith  but knowing you i know that youre glad to be alive and grateful and sorry because i killed the snake even though i had to 
 the snake was beautiful wasnt it asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger 
now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him  were all gods creatures arent we 
you love this village and these stinking brown people because theyre gods creatures too and you love ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even a little more because hes a beautiful man 
were all gods creatures arent we penny all of us that is except me 
you actually hate me and we both know it because i killed that filthy snake well why dont you say something 
she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because keith was between her and the invader he knew she was not sulking not even angry at him 
the brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space 
at first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war but after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself 
and keiths record of kills made him a man to listen to a man paradoxically who might even survive he became a fighter pilot after the stint over the hump in the big crates 
and he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it because he was chemically incapable of fear that was true but only half the truth 
not defending england or being an ace or fighting for humanity and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi 
the nazis bombed britain so the raf retaliated and shot them all down it was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better organized and technically superior 
keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked they grounded him over his protests not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the command offices 
penny knew him better on her part he had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals 
he had strength in his sixfoot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep 
the pretty little twittering wacs said he had the look of eagles and penny hating the cliche had to admit that in this case it applied but they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly 
the nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit the command post was underground and well camouflaged 
there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along this one was actually more of a near miss 
there was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered that is everyone but keith and penny 
keith was on his feet because he didnt care at all about life any more penny on her feet proudly because she cared too much the blast damaged but did not destroy the room 
and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to penny and took her hand in his the chaplain married them on the next day 
she came from ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmertype farmers but to keiths londonbred mind such acreage sounded rather invincible 
keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles 
that was his true love not penny the terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose 
when they got to shillong in assam he was happy this was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread 
he even hunted elephant although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african cousin but there are big rogues in both countries 
he and penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah and while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the eden they were traversing 
there were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close 
now the next morning they were anchored at the elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down ### fathoms with the weighted line beside it and robinson roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface 
the german courteously indicated that robinson should mount first robinson clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his tripletank assembly 
 temper temper mrs forsythe said laughing uneasily a phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was not yet ten am
 all i have to do to set the record is to go on down  was it something went bad with the breathing 
he was a huge young man of twentyfour clothed in muscle immensely strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation ive been that far half a dozen times 
 well i get it artie said still on the ladder  you are a big musclebound ape and you got this idea about setting a record 
 no it wasnt that rob said a note of awe came into his voice 
i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening  pressurehappy artie said and climbed in 
he had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him waddell the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut heavyframed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat 
 our boy didnt chicken out no sir he ran into the rapture of the depths 
 maybe not if youre ### feet under water artie said personally i dont blame him for giving up the dive much as i regret losing the story 
he stood there towering over them all gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group  you think i got you and artie and herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride 
he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels he went to key west every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of commodore was never used without irony 
now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride  why he went on when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip i didnt think twice about it 
hell i gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it rob  seven years ago commodore rob said impassively 
 excuse me he said abruptly he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters 
 when you gotta go you gotta go mrs forsythe said waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge 
 hi there schaffner he had said  can i make you one 
 i do not drink so much thank you waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up 
his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommels afrika corps and he said to himself id hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night 
 yes herr schaffner had said  hes one hell of a decent boy 
 well no herr schaffner said why thats his main reason for making the dive 
 please let me explain the german said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit  i have in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year 
i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products with all respect to a fine young man mr roy is not able to provide these necessaries 
 did you tell him all this  perhaps not in so many words the german said 
never never did i offer him the exclusive rights we spoke of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity 
but there was no definite agreement about business arrangements  well damn waddell said 
 you intend to speak with mr roy  if you will pardon i think it would be better if not 
i know this from my talks with him  well lets let him make up his own mind ok 
 you will make him unhappy and anxious the german said  at ### ### ### feet under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will be thinking about what you are telling him 
there was no doubt that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk 
 i will give mr roy his due for this dive i will make him distributor for all of florida a big market 
but there is no use causing him to worry at this time the germans words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty 
it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this  i think maybe youre right schaffner he said 
 by god waddell said we dont want to upset the boy at this time of all times he sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps 
the rewards prompt and juicy in modern bigbusiness america  thank you the german had said courteously 
now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions 
 blessed saint nicholas i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when i was bewildered and when i make the dive again he paused 
folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters  holy mary mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next dive 
and make my life different and better from this time on as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk 
he waited awhile before he said roy you know your decompression table dont you  you know i know it robinson answered warily 
 well i was a little bit confused anyway i wasnt down long enough to matter 
 you know what they say about two deep dives in one day artie went on still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently  i dont think you should go down again 
as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed 
for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting 
his remembering the selfdictate brought no peace only a faint chill of doubt he murmured to himself with firmness no surrender 
his superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide 
he sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife 
besides the belt he wore a loin cloth as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing 
his fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist  come out come out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath 
matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills 
even now like a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flamethrowers squirting great orange billows a wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his uniform blazing 
matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun the callous marines had laughed at each others retching while stacking bodies 
apprehensively he peered to the left to the right into the leafy vinecrisscrossed maze he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with the one left to distract him 
because he couldnt hear them he was more convinced they were there a spectacle occurred across the meadow the lone marine took a seat on the ground 
while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver taking aim at the mans face matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind 
the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle 
matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes 
but jumping right up he staggered in no particular direction he wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon 
when he got closer to the tree matsuo noted the wild look on his face the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot him in the upper trunk 
in the hush that followed the echoes matsuo was tense they could come on him now without difficulty 
down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended 
rifle leveled on the man he made a rush heat in the sunlight pressed in like an invisible crowd 
with a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone 
maintaining his clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets in one a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter both sticky from the mans bleeding 
one by one he tossed the objects aside he didnt smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter 
then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief from its holder he took his own canteen 
the marines eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted in the glare matsuo put the bottle to his own lips 
not only had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on  you came well equipped to die 
drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his bivouac the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned 
awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle the smell of sake had freshened yesterdays events in his thoughts 
 are you a thrower of flame marine matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground out of the marines reach and away from their shadows 
its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was dripping 
the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle 
even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved the marines handkerchief to wrap it first he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes 
with a firm grip on the mans hair matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek a shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands that circled matsuos wrist 
burned each hand when they came groping again the marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment 
he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the rifle behind a shoulder the marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach 
as matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow in the jungle birds were mute while insects preserved only the monotony of living 
then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat once and for all hed finish this marine who would not die 
the man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container he performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct 
the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle 
he was very thirsty but he must observe water discipline his years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline 
popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted of course it was water he really craved 
the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack and when this was gone he hadnt even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool 
the upper part of his packet had stained dark there is nothing for you matsuo said 
from the convulsive quivers of the mans shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping he reminded matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china 
chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were 
he leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed  since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town boys 
he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer  stay right here where you are kid he called 
he didnt stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leaders right hand was on the butt of his revolver  im billy tilghman said the stranger and ive come for pat conyers body 
most of the time i get what i ask for  the kid has no manners boys 
tilghmans clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin his head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling 
a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghmans stomach as blue throats henchmen started shooting tilghman flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun 
somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled you all right billy  yes george but i aint got poor old pats body yet 
another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor  ok tilghman im quitting 
tilghman and his partner george rust herded the men into a corner  and now said tilghman with deadly calm ill repeat what i said 
blue throat nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the survivors of the fight  that critter will be back tomorrow predicted george rust and hell bring fifty of his kind back with him 
 amen said the reverend doran grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere billy tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle 
it was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a riproaring ruthless gunslinger and this was the timehonored wild west method of doing it he rode in at the head of sixty triggerhappy and liquorcrazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to main street 
any posse riding down the street to demand blue throats surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire the lawabiding citizens of petrie had gathered inside kasters store halfway down the street 
he sized up the situation and shook his head  if blue throat has his way hell keep us all cooped up in here for days he said 
he called the store owner and together they went into the stockroom  im gonna drop these into blue throats lap he announced and id like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near enough to toss em through the window 
blue throats men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barbers shop and came out at the back 
all he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside 
though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts to tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hairraising smashemdown adventures on the side of the law which started in #### when he was only eighteen years old and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet 
he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gunslinging character in the book he saw the most action beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal who lived before or after him 
the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of heroworship but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his actionpacked career his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the west have remained almost unsung citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century 
led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks making liberal use of their guns bill doolins ambition it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of jesse james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had sworn he would stop him 
they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their houses billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named ed dunn who lived at rock fort 
it was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside the only evidence of occupation came from the chimney which was belching out thick smoke 
 wait here neal said tilghman  if i dont come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse 
there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day 
 hello ed said tilghman the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didnt move 
suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck along each side of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain 
the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide thinking fast tilghman never hesitated for one instant 
the men behind them were bill doolin and five of his gang every man a killer  cold day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire 
cant seem to locate landmarks in this snow  follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely 
resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling deathtrap tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes all that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body 
 well he announced guess ill be going now ed and thanks for the warmup he strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him 
as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed just what is meant by spirit and by matter 
yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreedupon elements of experience 
when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit 
not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true demons fairies angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars 
in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it 
the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time 
in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions there have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful 
the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit 
we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience 
the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur millers play the crucible which deals with the salem witch trials as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century 
the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures foibles irritations and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people 
a teenage girl abigail williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the demon world is populated with real creatures and witches actually can be seen flying through the air 
everyone in salem saint and sinner alike is swept up by it it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with abigail and parris spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it 
the audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes if one asks about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give than spirit 
in the end the good man john proctor expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire a fire is burning i hear the boot of lucifer i see his filthy face 
we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this yet are not we of the midtwentieth century who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil just as bad off as they only in a different way 
we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false even mr miller himself seems uncertain on this score 
and his belief is not to his discredit better minds than hales were and still are convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken 
the concept of unity in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good and evil are relative everchanging and always joined to the same phenomenon such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of mans worthlessness until redeemed the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or churchstate 
yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power 
for this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the authors convictions to the contrary 
apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity cohesiveness and permanence think for example of the spirit of the marine corps 
we cannot of course assign it any substance it is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time 
so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity 
for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere 
yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas 
the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them it is for them a given which they and they alone possess 
it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people and this it must not be forgotten is one of the goals of the perennial theological task there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation 
the absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents bultmanns intention his point is not that mythology may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the christian kerygma 
mythological concepts may by all means still be used but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological or existential terms the statement is often made that when bultmann argues in this way he overestimates the intellectual stumblingblock which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith 
nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated on the contrary even in the heart of the bible belt itself as can be attested by any one who is called to work there the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way together with the corresponding changes in mans picture of himself and his world 
although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class 
the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme cultureprotestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the american churches in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation 
but it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected however even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace 
but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to god as their wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the foolishness of god and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing 
there is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church which derives however from the heritage of the greeks rather than from the bible that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world by analogy the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church 
and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends 
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction but the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable 
if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful follower of jesus christ is some form of selfdestruction whether of the body or of the mind sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid 
modern man as dietrich bonhoeffer has told us has come of age and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is in fact marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation it is still a positive step forward 
in any event it is an irreversible step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us to say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought 
it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong for we must number here not only the names of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of the brothers niebuhr and if america may claim him 
what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their christianity 
when we say then that today in our situation the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement however much we may have to criticize liberal theologys constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it 
for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion only one is really an alternative if the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally the position of the right is clearly untenable 
it follows then provided the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least is found in much that is significant in american and english theology in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length 
to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question thus if what is at issue is whether all s is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question is false 
for in either event the first possibility is excluded therefore the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand by the two at least apparently selfconsistent but mutually exclusive positions of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third but really pseudo position analogous to a round square of bultmann 
 # accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation and # in so doing frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that from bultmanns point of view are mythological 
representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the roman and anglican churches and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was condemned by the holy office in #### now again in #### in england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as christian unity 
many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in #### than there was in #### but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope at least on the catholic side 
i came to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of cardinal newman as an american catholic of irish ancestry i came with certain preconceptions and expectations 
since arriving here however i have formed a far different religious picture of presentday england in representing part of this new picture i will be recounting some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments 
since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit my roman collar and black garb usually identify me in england as a roman catholic cleric in any case i have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by englishmen even in devonshire and cornwall where anticatholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest 
on my first guy fawkes day here i found catholics as well as noncatholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires and was told that most englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the true story of guy fawkes which began 
in the ### years since the first guy fawkes night much of the story has been forgotten so here is a reminder the article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king james # 
the return of the catholic hierarchy in #### was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty in #### newman professedly had to write his apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers 
yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population a protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham oratory catholic church on sunday mornings 
she may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services 
the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches according to a newspaper report of the #### statistics of the church of england the total of confirmed members is ####### but only ####### are registered on the parochial church rolls and over ## million people in england are baptized into the church of england but roughly only a tenth of them continue 
a further ### anglican churches have been demolished since #### and in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or more often the sale of ### chapels 
while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have emptied churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer protestants are going to church it should be admitted too that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing catholics one paper writes ## per cent 
an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true a century ago newman saw that liberalism what we now might call secularism would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and that even high anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own 
one of the ironies of the present crusade for christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real christians to unite many english catholics are proud of their catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy 
with traditional nationalistic spirit some englishmen claim that english catholicism is catholicism at its best i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics 
they hope of course to reclaim the noncatholic population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the prayer for england  o blessed virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon england thy dowry and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee 
 a hymn often to be heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which glories in englands ancient faith that endured persecution and which proclaims faith of our fathers marys prayers shall win our country back to thee the english saints are widely venerated quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty martyrs and cardinal newman will soon be canonized 
i have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air for example a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the english catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are unenglish 
one of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid##th century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics partly because religious tests were removed only in #### 
now not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the noncatholic members of the university catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the cherwell with noncatholic students 
the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester guardian and the sunday observer implies a kindly recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches on successive sundays during october #### paul ferris a noncatholic wrote articles in the observer depicting clergymen of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist church 
there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of midvictorian england 
catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal footing with protestant clergymen a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr ramsey recently appointed archbishop of canterbury 
the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months and it was interesting to observe that bbcs television film on christmas eve was the bells of st marys 
it was the first time an english primate has done this since the ##th century english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope 
news of a protestant minister in leamington who has offered to allow a catholic priest to preach from his pulpit a report that a catholic nun had been requested to teach in a noncatholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters 
a report that ### protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in slough during the church unity octave the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal 
but how can one figure symbolize both christianity declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur 
to be the savior and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with mans history 
his history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of jesus 
not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence 
the first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in adam as origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning so irenaeus portrays the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ 
from gods will and wisdom and from virgin earth for god had not rained says the scripture before man was made and there was no man to till the earth 
irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection 
therefore there is no need for him as there is for origen to identify existence itself with the fall existence is created and willed by god and is not the consequence of a preexistent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history 
in the similitude of god he created him there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude are sharply distinguished so most notably in the statement if the holy spirit is absent from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature 
thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster the similitude of god by contrast is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature 
he does not mean to say that adam lost the similitude of god and his immortality through the fall for he was created not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality as well as of mortality 
and he laid down for him certain conditions so that if he kept the command of god then he would always remain as he was that is immortal but if he did not he would become mortal melting into earth whence his frame had been taken 
yet he did not stop being human as a result there is no justification for systematizing the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of god humanity and the similitude of god immortality 
he was in the words of irenaeus beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality the true way to immortality lay through obedience but man did not believe this 
and even as she having indeed a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become disobedient was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race so also did mary having a man betrothed to her and being nevertheless a virgin by yielding obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race 
his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the virgin eve and the virgin mary that parallelism affects his picture of mans disobedience too 
with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality at the nadir of that circuit is death 
wherefore as they became forfeit to death from that moment they were handed over to it this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they disobeyed namely on a friday as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday 
in any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained mortality instead mans life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god must now be conformed to the shape of death 
even death therefore has a providential as well as a punitive function  wherefore also he god drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree of life not because he envied him the tree of life as some venture to assert but because he pitied him and did not desire that he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable 
this idea which occurs in both tatian and cyprian fits especially well into the scheme of irenaeus theology for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ 
it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is it is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next 
this emphasis upon death rather than sin as mans fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early theologians especially the greekspeaking ones they speak of the work of christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility which can mean though it does not have to mean deliverance from time and history 
it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified 
such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older in short whether adams life was intended to be part of the process of time if it was then it must have been gods intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity 
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal the embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change 
it is the wages of sin and its sting is the law if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator 
if death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal ie created existence such an interpretation of death radically alters the christian view of creation 
because christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understanding of the work of christ furthermore as an encouragement to revisionist thinking it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes 
ezra stiles gannett an honorable representative of the sanhedrin addressed himself frankly to the issue in #### insisting that parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist even so gannett judiciously argued the association could legitimately decide that parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness 
one can even argue though this is a delicate matter that every justification existed for their returning the public lecture to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it finally it did seem clear as day to these clergymen as gannetts son explained in the biography of his father they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of christians 
grant all this still when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insults parker lavished upon them or else argue that after all parker received the treatment he invited they betray an uneasy conscience whenever new england liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january ## #### while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association while it may plead that dr n l frothingham had every warrant for stating the difference between trinitarians and unitarians is a difference in christianity 
had it done so the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parkers insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi happily for posterity then the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality 
whereupon parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room though not out of the fellowship in the hall after adjournment dr frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested parker to visit him whereupon our burly theodore again burst into tears 
it was indeed a near thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england which we inherit did triumph to the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it 
in both cases the stubborn fact remains liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates both legitimate offspring of its loins and when brought to the test it behaved shabbily suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion 
however there is a crucial difference between the two histories emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside or rather by leaving it behind him he walked out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wound of his departure preserve its selfrespect and eventually accord him pious veneration 
hence he was in his lifetime as is the memory of him afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity he still points an accusing finger at all of us telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat 
it cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of selfdeprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him the fact is incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston was narrowminded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened 
nevertheless we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace their passions were genuine and the division between them and the abolitionists is clearcut 
even though his theological theses have become to us commonplaces the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us it has been endlessly rephrased but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant 
there can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior the gentle channing revered by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian wrote to a friend in louisville that among its many virtues boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action no city in the world is governed so little by a police and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment 
opinion is less individual or runs more into masses and often rules with a rod of iron even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius channing added remember this is channing not parker 
channing wrote this in a letter i think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons 
because he spoke openly with what channing had prophesied someone might with daring hyperbole parker vindicated channings further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines an institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution and only within those defined limits a license 
he arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with at the least resentment what otherwise could the lawyer doctor minister the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant and continually cried holy holy holy is the almighty dollar 
there are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom nor a mitre on their head who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar a pope much nearer home boston has been controlled by a few capitalists lawyers and other managers who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think 
it was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied and it was duty he would perform though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty parker could weep and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents 
we have to tell ourselves that when parker spoke in this vein he believed what he said because he could continue but the truth which cost me bitter tears to say i must speak though it cost other tears hotter than fire because he copiously shed his own tears and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other peoples consciences 
it is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody professing the deepest piety decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not christ transformed the water into wine at eleven am on the third of august ad ## we have no answer as to why we are not alarmed 
we have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor the majesterial andrews norton by saying that while he believed jesus like other religious teachers worked miracles i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt 
i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world in an amateurish yet in a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology geology astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields 
doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations attempting to bridge the chasm between an older reverent bibleloving generation and a critical doubting bibleemancipated race although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i stood outside shivering in the cold 
now if any part of the bible is assuredly the very word of god speaking through his servant it is johns gospel to ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible 
test it try it and if it works accept it as a guiding principle so i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked 
the next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submitted to its conditions according to christs invitation and promise that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself john # ## the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only begotten son of god son of man by the virgin mary the saviour of the world 
nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth 
the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body again as faith reveals god my father and christ my saviour i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer 
i discern no limits to a faith vested in god and christ who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world our lords invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see 
as i ministered to his needs i noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you 
what a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise tendered by the lord during his earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him he was about to leave them to depart from this world and return to his father in heaven 
i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lords guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients 
looking unto god the prophet isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee are you longing for peace in your heart 
as only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own perhaps you do not know if you belong to him 
 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace 
why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your saviour and let him fill you with peace that only he can give then with the hymn writer of old you can say 
i am kept from all danger by night and by day and his glory is flooding my soul

delinquency juvenile and adult is at an alltime high unfortunately in our rush to beat the russians we have forgotten these truthpacked words of jesus christ what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world that includes outer space and lose his own soul 
gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business according to gods standards it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments 
 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john # never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link

that is why the bible commands you to taste and see that the lord is good blessed happy is the man that trusteth in him psalm ## # you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith 
 as many as received him jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name  the lord is my light and my salvation 
of whom shall i be afraid a certain teacher scheduled a fear party for her fourth grade pupils 
the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks wouldnt it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries dr george w crane a medical columnist thinks it would 
each week an estimated ## million patients call upon us doctors of this number ##% or ## million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever 
one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days 
one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and he reported that ##% of them worried about things that never happened ##% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control 
##% of them worried about their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves only #% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention 
what is the real cause of them what is there about us that makes us so anxious 
we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers we spend billions of dollars at the race tracks and more billions on other forms of gambling 
we consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moments relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks and after he had seen it all he said to a friend you must be a very sad people 
he should have said jittery for thats what we are watch people flock to amusement houses cocktail lounges and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something 
yes and as tension mounts in this world fear is increasing does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business 
i doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then 
maybe we are talking about them too much the question is what are we going to do about them 
hitler did just that ## years ago building up tensions that first led to a munich and then to a world war the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate 
it could have the same effect on communists the president of the united states has said we will never negotiate out of fear and we will never fear to negotiate 
and thats another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears to develop the poise that promotes peace turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do that 
the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid 
he didnt live in a world of perpetual peril like ours he didnt know anything about the problems we face today 
though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident that is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today isnt it 
he has already devoured huge areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire reducing them to slavery systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison yes indeed we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us 
a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west but was shot and killed 
the entrance to a church has been walled up so that the congregation most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there anymore practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city 
but the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity there is only one escape left a tragic one and too many people are taking it suicide 
these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door we are all involved in them deeply involved 
he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world the lord is my light and my salvation the lord is the strength of my life 
notice that this man had a threefold conception of god which is the secret of his faith first the lord is my light 
the same god who called this world into being when he said let there be light  those were his very first creative words he began the world with light this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness 
in fact he came into this world himself in the person of his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the psalmist could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ 
we live in the bright daylight of that great event for us it is a fact in history 
this is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of god the lord is my salvation he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins 
the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul and god had conquered that one by his grace 
the apostle paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things if god be for us who can be against us 
shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword this is the key to the conquest of fear 
when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ when we know that he is our savior that he has paid our debt with his blood that he has met the demands of gods justice and thus has turned his wrath away when we know that we have peace with god in our hearts and then with this god on our side we can face the whole world without fear 
it recalls those words of another psalm god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth 
thus while it remains possible that the babylonians and/or the pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years the lo shu square as an expression of centrality
but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor shih huangti in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hardwon national unity was the burning of the books in ### bc with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking 
many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning of the vast chin palace some ten years later yet some must have survived because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persisted on into the han dynasty which succeeded in reuniting china and keeping it together for a longer period from ### bc to ad ### 
however the wei books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in ### after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which was already semisecret anyhow 
although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical puzzle was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured chinese for so many centuries they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself but up to now no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers singly or in combination and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concepts 
the importance of this # can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers quite apart from any numerological considerations which is to say any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it indeed mathematically speaking it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram 
then if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square through multiplying it by the highest number # which is the square of the base number the result is ## and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed 
it is also their mathematical mean since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal ## in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese 
and in this square the respective pairs made up of large and small odd yang numbers and those composed of large and small even yin numbers were all equal to each other thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts erased in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis 
these twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the han dynasty the existing reverence for centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century bc when the han emperor wu ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions and took # as the dynastic number believing that he would thus place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious influences 
after this time inscriptions on the han bronze mirrors as well as other writings emphasized the desirability of keeping ones self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally 
we find for example such groupings as the five ancient rulers the five sacred mountains the five directions with center the five metals five colors five tastes five odors five musical notes five bodily functions five viscera and many others this trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the five elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest 
and why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four obviously something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives and that may have been the workings of the lo shu 
whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded chinese thought scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in china for many centuries 
although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu held for the old chinese philosophers this was actually only a beginning of wonders for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time 
but conversely one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the teachings of the yinyang and fiveelements school which was traditionally founded by tsou yen 
heaven acting through the tao expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles the yin and the yang the yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun 
together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang while the even numbers were yin so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center 
instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional nine provinces as was usually done this equated the odd yang numbers with mountains firm and resistant hence yang and the even numbers with rivers sinuous and yielding hence yin taking the former from the five sacred mountains of the han period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china 
the # taishan in shantung east china the # hwashan in shensi west china 
and the # huoshan in anhwei which was then the south sacred mountain for the rivers the # represented the huai to the then southeast 
the # the chi in the northeast and the # the upper yellow river in the northwest 
but in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was equated with the nine provinces 
few persons who join the church are insincere they earnestly desire to do the will of god 
these fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism a failure to follow through a program of lay visitation evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship 
in the average situation about onethird of those visited make commitments to christ and the church the pastor and the membership preparation and assimilation committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program 
churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep ## to ## per cent of their new members loyal and active this is the answer to the problem of membership delinquency 
it is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received 
some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors it should not be postponed later than the next day 
the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference if possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present 
he will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private devotions and the importance of the membership preparation sessions there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel 
a piece of devotional material such as the upper room may be left in each home a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults 
they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes 
some pastors have two sessions in one evening with a refreshment period between the sessions should cover four major areas a
this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday 
the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church school missions mens work womens work youth program social activities and finances the budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session 
 the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members 
some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday night or during the week this gives greater opportunity for the learning process 
some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly 
use a textbook with assigned readings each week select class members for reports on various phases of the study 
ask each member to write a statement on such topics as what christ means to me what the church means to me why join the church the duties of church members etc assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized 
ask each new member to bring his pledge of loyalty to the reception service there is a growing conviction among pastors and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need preparatory training including those coming by transfer of membership 
people appreciate experiences that demand something of them those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule 
those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed the preparatory class is an introductory facetoface group in which new members become acquainted with one another 
the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church this should be a high moment in their lives a nevertobeforgotten experience 
every detail of the service merits careful attention the hymns the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction to the congregation the welcome of the congregation this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation 
it can mean the difference between participation and inaction spiritual growth and decay the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church 
psychologically the reception should be the climax following the sermon ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards 
provide a name card for each new member arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together 
give each new member a certificate of membership introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation 
have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board 
chapter # planning for the assimilation and growth of new membersthe church is the family of god 
every member of the family must have a vital place in its life yet the most difficult problem in the churchs program of evangelism is right at this point helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship 
a study of major denominational membership statistics over a twentyyear period revealed the appalling fact that nearly ## per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years one denomination had a membership of ####### at the beginning of the period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### a net growth of only ###### 
another major church body had ####### members and twenty years later its membership stood at ####### during this time ####### new members were brought into the fellowship 
during this period ####### members were received yet the net membership now is only ####### these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership 
studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received the local family of god has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare 
but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life the entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process 
those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian discipleship 
the church expects certain things of those who become members the new members justifiably expect some things from their church family 
care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands the statement also points to a classic paradox the more men turn toward god who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another 
massacres attending the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender the words of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind oh how we hate one another for the love of god 
institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms 
for every criterion which defines what something is at the same time proclaims implicitly if not openly what that something is not some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether 
man is at once a gregarious animal and a formcreating being having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance 
both eventualities are possible logically but practically they are impossible as much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in god they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him 
is there any way out of the predicament the only way that i can see is through communication 
approached creatively it is a high art it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart gods intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary 
what are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history i shall touch on three areas personal national and theological 
some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame distrust denounce and even hate modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally 
to some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeeming features whatsoever 
while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism is more variable the specific instance i have in mind is the afroasian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century 
no less than twentytwo nations have already achieved independence since world war # and the number is growing by the year as an obvious consequence obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and nonchristians in these lands 
actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries 
insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate transpolitical justifications for their existence such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone elses all this works severely against the kind of crosscultural communication for which christian missions stand 
the people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course christians on the mainland of china for example in burma and ceylon many buddhists argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion 
again india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries and fanatical hindu parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for tolerance due to nehru and his followers is gone the progressive closing of afroasian ears to the christian message is epitomized in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from jerusalem to cairo 
he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them after returning to the united states and raising the money he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available 
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of antichristian sentiment 
although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and nonchristians in asia the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain afroasian religions themselves the partition of india has hardly improved relations between hindus and muslims 
the modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof 
the trend throughout the worlds religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment pakistan was created in #### expressly as a muslim state but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of islam for the modern political situation 
the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan is determinedly secular and while the nation was formerly named the islamic republic of pakistan it is now simply the republic of pakistan 
the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis the sinai campaign the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties 
and in this country gustave weigels delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father weigels theological argument 
my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student volunteer movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed 
leslie newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and his finished work but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it newbiggins qualification on the christian claim is of considerable significance 
in mentioning this under salvation reconsidered i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean 
yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil repelled sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by mans own action i mean however that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit 
he is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result as it efficaciously does some good he is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both 
this is what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result means it means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends 
certainly in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account 
presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account there must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm 
nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences he does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action 
he does what he can and may and must without regarding himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done 
mr philip toynbee writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues if it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin 
he bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically ie by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few years this would be by far the better choice when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish 
 the worst and least probable result  if it didnt prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing 
if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are thus moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality 
several of the replies to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil  it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation 
but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduced by precautions against accidents or by limiting war  quoting mr kennans phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war he toynbee says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war 
 if philip toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war i think he is right i do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war 
let us therefore put first things first and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be mr philip toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of orwell in nineteen eightyfour if he believed communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world 
no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some paxordo preserved by clothed or naked force 
not to repel injury and uphold and improve paxordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment 
would such an act of refusal be useful he does not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition that if we took the risk of surrendering a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender 
this is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war by creating a monopoly in one power of the worlds arsenal of unlimited weapons it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it in the past 
hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last 
the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race 
finally just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to accelerate this end we should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankinds thrusts toward we know not what future 
for almost onesixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as selfevident by most americans few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders 
it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country it is not surprising that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association of real estate boards nareb and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure 
what does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest what ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change 
recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan universitys public affairs center sought some answers to these questions several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers political scientists economists social psychologists social ethicists and theologians 
for a number of years wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them 
within the membership of this group as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner 
obviously much more than customer expectation is determining the realtors role judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers income educational level and above all racial extraction 
how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of narebs code of ethics article ## in the code adopted in #### states that a realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood though the reference to race was stricken by the association in #### being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid 
all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced nonwhite particularly negro peoples into allwhite restricted areas they would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform and this was no longer to be a pro 
these men for the most part educated in our best new england colleges well established financially and socially in the community under kindly but insistent probing reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a clientservice relationship this narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase 
realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church laymen as university alumni as newspaper readers etc from such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding 
 # their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes and most pervasively # their interpretation of who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in a technical fragmented society 
the commission on race and housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced on the whole than any other segment of the american population but such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both nareb and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices 
like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make realtors both generally and in this group have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension 
there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the negroes desire for wellkept housing privacy etc data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in 
significantly no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes published by the university of california press that present the commissions findings no one anticipates any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised 
relevant facts however extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of ones democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife 
on the positive side recent federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position antidiscriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage 
as far as they were aware the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the bills passage or lobbied in its support  this has not been the case everywhere 
official reasoning the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights there are sins of omission as well as commission 
judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v kraemer #### has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have repudiated the principle in such clauses 
but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into allwhite neighborhoods one of the roles of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work 
such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that embraces scarsdale or yonkers but is also infinitely richer since it is allinclusive that community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment 
thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions  # over the years individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed 
but what significance attaches to professional beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a clients stated needs as already noted our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other 
if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization science and religion science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom 
how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge and yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision 
and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom 
it was only about the size of a baseball but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of ##### tons of aj 
and with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world 
hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce we know that we have hydrogen in water 
there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body i would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima 
and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond salt water is still af the same hydrogen is there 
of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days 
with just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come 
now let us see where this power comes from to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is 
one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms and i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an area would they cover 
that is a figure one with ## ciphers quite a large number then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator 
a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia 
imagine that there is a blizzard over pennsylvania but instead of snowing snow it snows peas so we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep 
pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas but we still have a long way to go 
next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect ### planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep finally we go into the farthest reaches of the milky way 
so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it 
i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long 
and if you should step inside of such a magnified atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see circulating over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs these balls are moving in great circles and ellipses and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone 
so you look down there and you see a tiny whirling point about the size of the head of a pin this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus 
it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits it also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy 
and since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper 
at any rate it shows us how immaterial we are now this #### view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture 
and therefore the atom was really just a little machine and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts 
and since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a supermachine and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom 
then came the scientific revolution in the late ####s a suggestion from louis de broglie a physicist in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves 
now as you step inside instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it these ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral 
it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure are there 
and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts lies about thirtyone miles southeast of its mother state 
the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors during about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers food and cars 
this is a fine trip too on a good day with marthas vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about three hours 
how far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age to what extent did it mould the morals and the social economic and political life and institutions of the country 
even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of christianity from other factors although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor 
what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation as we have seen a growing proportion although in #### still a minority were members of churches 
many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenthcentury immigration 
upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation upon most of these christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was 
at best only an approximation could be arrived at to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd 
the temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed 
if guilty the offender might be excluded from membership as church membership burgeoned such measures faded into desuetude 
what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation we have already hinted at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life 
throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour 
the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the protestantism of the older stock thus america the most widely sung of the patriotic songs was written by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis smith ######## while a student in andover theological seminary 
the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith here was what was called the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it 
america america god mend thy every flaw confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears 
the american dream was compounded of many strains some were clearly of christian origin among them the great awakening and other revivals which helped to make christian liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of the land 
here too must be placed unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth among them melville hawthorne and henry james the elder all of them out of a christian background 
a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism 
quakers some from new england had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england ancestry also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the seventh day adventists christian science the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology 
the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others looked for the early coming of the millennium and was paralleled by the confidence in mans ability cherished by the unitarians emerson and the transcendentalists we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isles and the pietism of the continent of europe among them prison reform antislavery measures legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour the inner mission and the red cross 
a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century 
still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age the movement to end negro slavery began before #### and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil war emancipation was achieved 
for example in #### the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in #### it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental congress to abolish slavery 
beginning at least as far back as #### various baptist bodies condemned slavery after #### antislavery sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock 
benjamin lundy ######## a quaker was a pioneer in preparing the way for antislavery societies it was he who turned the attention of william lloyd garrison ######## to the subject 
chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition he also espoused a great variety of other causes among them womens rights prohibition and justice to the indians incurably optimistic dogmatic and utterly fearless in his youth a devout baptist in spite of his friendship for the quaker poet john greenleaf whittier ######## he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the bible 
finney himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on evangelism but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the antislavery campaign theodore dwight weld ######## was especially active 
as a youth he became one of finneys band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men a strong temperance advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles stewart another finney convert he devoted himself to the antislavery cause 
the majority then went to the infant oberlin they and others employed some of finneys techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause 
he shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame wendell phillips ######## from a prominent massachusetts family in his teens was converted under the preaching of lyman beecher 
he was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the freedmen and for prohibition the antislavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by arthur tappan ######## and his younger brother lewis tappan ######## 
they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer even more terrible abilities their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe 
thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors but this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities 
the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world 
this is the familiar system of cosmic government the chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifested divine powers 
by swaying the balance between them he effected the alternation of the seasons his power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions 
failure in daily moral and ethical duties to ones family outrages to community propriety any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead and to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters 
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear 
the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code 
modern westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection living in urban conditions away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatchedroof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes 
in china the magical system par excellence was taoism the taoists were quietist mystics who saw an unchanging unity the tao underlying all phenomena 
the taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation in other words they were actually an organization of magicians 
after this form of indian buddhism had been introduced into china it underwent extensive changes during its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical zen morsels offered to the modern western reader 
the selfrealized mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that made the world into a huge magical garden 
nonmagical confucianism was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power 
but let us not be mistaken about confucian virtue this was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation 
propriety was synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for mans fate 
promoters of zen to the west record its ancestry and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism but the marvelous person that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese practicality than indian speculation he possesses magical powers and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls 
but in the chinese mind there was little difference between the two the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be actually zen owes more to chinese quietism than it does to mahayana buddhism 
this is well evidenced by the quietist doctrines carried over in zen the idea of the inward turning of thought the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity peace and stillness a union with the infinite with the tao could be effected in fact the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking zennist was a feature of taoism 
zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience one of its features attractive to the west is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts 
but this is not the spirit of selfreliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistakes it it is simply that in taoist tradition as in all good mysticisms books words or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience 
reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive handicap the technique of reality confusion the use of paradox and riddles to shake the minds grip on reality originated with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism the koan is not basically a new device 
in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdomwide ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers and this is only natural witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug 
but this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers the anchorite strove in fact to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power 
as the zen literature reveals as soon as an early zen master attained fame in seclusion he was called out into the world to exercise his powers the early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles 
in support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity hwang pah o baku one day going up mount tien tai which was believed to have been inhabited by arhats with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light 
there being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to hwang pah to follow him 
the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praised him as a true mahayanist a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess on one occasion yang shan kyozan saw a stranger monk flying through the air 
 early this morning replied the other i set out from india  why said the teacher art thou so late 
 thou mayst have supernatural powers exclaimed yang shan yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to me then the monk praised yang shan saying i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri and met unexpectedly with minor shakya and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india went back through the air 
a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular zen attitudes to the zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be appeased 
modern zen presentation to the west insists on the antiauthoritarian highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief scriptures are burned to make fire action is based on direct selfconfidence and so on this picture of extreme selfreliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such zendo formulas as o you demons and other spiritual beings i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith 
a plenary indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading pope pius the sixth at rome in april #### wrote the following the faithful should be excited to the reading of the holy scriptures for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times 
 we hope they said that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures they recommended also that at a fixed hour let the entire family be assembled for night prayers followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures 
do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again the new birth is necessary because god is holy 
for it is written you shall be holy because i am holy holiness without which no man will see god 
as it is written there is not one just man all have sinned and have need of the glory of god 
therefore as through one man sin entered into the world and through sin death and thus death has passed unto all men because all have sinned you also when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins 
in their case the god of this world satan has blinded their unbelieving minds that they should not see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god # corinthians # # # 
the new birth is effected through the word of godfor you have been reborn not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible through the word of god 
amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again of water symbol of the word of god see ephesians ## and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh 
if we are born of god we have faith in christ as the only saviour everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god 
if we are born of god we do not practice sin as a habit whoever is born of god does not commit sin that is he does not practice sin 
we know that no one who is born of god commits sin  the new nature received at the time of regeneration is divine and holy and as the believer lives under the power of this new nature he does not practice sin 
if you know that he god is just righteous know that everyone also who does what is just righteous has been born of him if we are born of god we love god 
if we are born of god we love the brethren we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren 
if we are born of god we overcome the world all that is born of god overcomes the world 
if we are born of god we grow in not into but in grace but grow in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ 
i am convinced of this that he who has begun a good work in you will bring it to perfection until the day of christ jesus now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in gladness to the only god our savior through jesus christ our lord belong glory and majesty dominion and authority before all time and now and forever 
jesus answered and said to him nicodemus amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god  amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god 
and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not wonder that i said to thee you must be born again 
if then any man is in christ he is a new creature literally he is a new creation the former things have passed away for by grace you have been saved through faith 
not as the outcome of works lest anyone may boast for his workmanship we are created in christ jesus 
he who has the son has the life he who has not the son has not the life 
the new birth is the impartation of the divine nature through which he has granted us the very great and precious promises so that through them you may become partaker of the divine nature 
christ in you your hope of glory it is now no longer i that live but christ lives in me 
to have christ dwelling through faith in your hearts the wind blows where it will and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes 
amen amen i say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has life everlasting and does not come to judgment but has passed from death to life the new birth is a work of god 
to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god you may be very religious a good church member an upright honest and sincere person 
you may attend mass do penance say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment 
our blessed lord jesus christ the sinless son of god who could not lie said amen amen i say to thee unless a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god st john # #  you must be born again st john # # 
you may do as you please with god now god placed himself in mens hands when he sent jesus christ into the world as perfect god and perfect man in one being 
you can do likewise though christ is not bodily present you can ignore his book the bible and his church 
the eternal christ may knock at your souls door calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven you may refuse him spit on him call him a devil curse him 
on the other hand you may seek his favor humble yourself before him and beg his mercy implore his forgiveness forsake your sins and abandon your whole life to him he has said behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me revelation ### 
the choice is yours the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with god the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of holy spirit discipline 
god has already set the day when you will be in his hands what he does with you then depends on what you do with him now 
this issue that you are reading marks my ##th anniversary when i came into being ## years ago i had one primary purpose to help men and women everywhere to know god better and through knowing him better to become happier and more effective people 
some of the people who speak through my pages are famous some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope 
fifteen years ago there were no guideposts at all this month a million guideposts will circulate all over the world 
they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following to me the explanation is very simple 
it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even when they turn away from it it is the power that holds the stars in their orbits but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass 
it is mankinds wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace all things are possible to god but he chooses usually to work through people 
fifteen years ago troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the postwar world a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women regardless of creed or color could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their idea 
compared to the big established magazines my first efforts seemed feeble indeed but from the start they had two important ingredients sincerity and realism 
for example early in my life when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of new yorks downandouters he didnt just ask questions len lesourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days 
the help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere the crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me 
 youre not living up to your own principles she told my discouraged people  youre so preoccupied that youve let your faith grow dim 
visualize them then believe you are getting them and you will have them and now a million january guideposts are in circulation 
today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees they say all personnel have spiritual needs which guideposts helps to meet 
they say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the armed forces to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere 
three years ago it became possible to finance a braille edition for blind readers throughout these exciting years i have been fortunate for although i have never offered great financial inducements talent has found its way to me william boal who so ably organizes business operations 
searching for the best in spiritual stories my roving editors cover not only the country but the whole world glenn kittler has been twice to africa once spending a week with dr albert schweitzer

we have also seen the power of faith at work among us rose weiss who handles all the prayerrequests that we receive answering each letter personally has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering she has had many major operations and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches 
we prayed for john during surgery we asked others to pray all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him 
but you see those who are not mentioned will not resent it that is the kind of people they are 
serious yes but also much laughter sharp division of opinion too and strenuous debate 
and there is also something intangible that hovers around the table each meeting starts with a prayer offered spontaneously by one member of the group

havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of mens eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices rumors flew from lip to lip that fidel castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains where he had fought batista for five years 
and then castro himself did come bearded smiling yet if you looked closely youd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips 
i am sure that castro was happy too about that support diario de la marina was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny 
my own earliest memories are of exiles my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the dictator machado when it was my turn i too printed the truth as i knew it about batista and rejoiced to see his regime topple 
i was full of hope as fidel castro came into havana within a week however i began to suspect that something was wrong 
he spent long hours before the tv spitting out promises of revenge he showed us how he dealt with his enemies he executed them before tv cameras 
he seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance new schools were rising but with this went a harsh proclamation any academic degree earned during batistas regime was invalid 
under another law hundreds of farms were seized farm workers had their wages cut almost in half 
a suspicion was growing that fidel castro was a communist in my mind i began to review his use of hate to gain support 
but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace what should i do about it i asked myself 
there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him mobs would appear outside our windows shouting paredon i was proud of the new buildings which housed diario now the rotogravures gleaming behind glass doors 
here was a powerful readymade medium but it could speak only if i told it to then one day early in january #### i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware of the crucifix 
i had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with sadness in his eyes saying 
it has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres the results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses eg garstung #### 
observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface radio observations of venus and jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets 
this result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and nonthermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence for the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a blackbody radiator and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and nonthermal components 
mars has been observed twice at about #cm wave length and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of mars the low intensity of the radiation from saturn has limited observations but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin 
in spite of this the very large radio reflectors and improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years the study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at ###cm wave length by dicke and beringer #### 
they deduced from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by pettit and nicholson #### and pettit #### 
piddington and minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves although opaque to infrared radiation the infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase 
the radio emission of a planet was first detected in #### when burke and franklin #### identified the origin of interferencelike radio noise on their records at about ## meters wave length as emission from jupiter this sporadic type of planetary radiation is discussed by burke chap ## and gallet chap ## 
in the relatively short time since these early observations venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from ## to ### cm and jupiter has been observed over the wavelength range from ### to ## aj the observable characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity the polarization and the direction of arrival of the waves 
this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large reflectors now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved it should be possible however to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers 
there have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation the measurements made with the nrl ##foot reflector which is altitudeazimuthmounted would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized 
other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation the concept of apparent blackbody temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets 
the apparent blackbody disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiates as a black body will the apparent blackbody temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emitting material 
the quiescent level of centimeter wavelength solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than #degree at meter wave lengths an increase of the order of ##degrees in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected 
radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from ## mm to ## cm and the results are summarized in table # observations have also been made at ## mm using optical techniques sinton #### #### 
in the observations at ## mm coates #### the diameter of the antenna beam ## was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases these observations indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions 
these contour diagrams also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude very recently observations have been made at #mm wave length with a reflector ## meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about # amenitskii noskova and salomonovich #### 
such highresolution observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted the observations of mayer mccullough and sloanaker at ### cm and of sloanaker at ### cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described 
the halfintensity diameter of the antenna beam was about # and the angle subtended by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes the antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured mayer mccullough and sloanaker #### so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known 
the measured brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moons disk is nearly uniform the result of the observations is af where the phase angle q is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors 
the variation in the #cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much less than the variation in the ##mm emission as would be expected from the explanation of piddington and minnett #### in the discussion which follows the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component and the superimposed periodic variation will be called the variable component 
the age of the moon was about # days the halfintensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was about ### and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon 
thus the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc it was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately ##% of the total arc energy 
the anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between ### amp and ### aj 
the high heat fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation the cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode 
in plasma generators as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than ##% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode the higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning arcs 
the heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects # heat of condensation work function plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging on the anode 
heat transfer by molecular conduction as well as by radiation from the arc column the heat transfer to the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up af 
the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode hence the flow conditions at the anode of free burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point 
the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these conditions however the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux 
the following possibilities exist for achieving this # the use of high voltages and low currents by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given power output 
feedback of the energy transferred to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode the third method was to our knowledge successfully applied for the first time by c sheer and coworkers ref # 
gas injection through a porous anode transpiration cooling not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself a detailed study of this latter phenomenon was not attempted in this paper 
sintered porous metals should be usable in principle however technical difficulties arise by melting at local hot spots 
thus direct comparisons can be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during the past years and decades by numerous investigators ref # figures # to # show photographic and schematic views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode holder 
this tube could be adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing the anode in figure # was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk 
inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere was prevented by the two disks shown in figure # argon was also blown at low velocities mass flow rate af through a tube coaxial with the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air 
the graphite was national carbon nc ## which has a porosity of ##% and an average pore size of ## this small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode 
a shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream temperature of the transpiring gas it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet 
this arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection two pyrometers shown in figure # and # pyrometer instrument co model ## served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder 
another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure # in this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant 
in addition the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the watercooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug 
the power source was a commercial d c rectifier at ### amp the ### cycle ripple was less than ## v peak to peak with a resistive load 
the arc voltage was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode and cathode holders because of the falling characteristic of the rectifier no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation 
the anode holder shown in figure # was designed with two goals in mind the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made 
the argon flow through the porous anode was varied systematically between af and af the lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable 
this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously for each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured 
as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug the size of this hot region was estimated by eye 
the mean temperature of this region was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot 
this calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures the upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple shown in figure # was af 
simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure # some of these temperatures are plotted in figure # 
thus the dotted line shown in figure # was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates the thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown in figure # indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of af 
it is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements the reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry 
it was calculated from the temperature gradient af at af inch as af the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby af 
the temperature dependent value of **ye was taken from ref # the radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to af where af is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures af and af calculated analogously to equation # 
it consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by shims there is a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed 
in normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks after it has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded 
the instrument used for this work was a slight modification of that previously described in this test a af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of af with a clearance of #### on each side of the tape 
this however can only be considered approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the buildup of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs the face of one block contained a hole #/## in diameter which led to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure 
two of the fluids showed a highpositive normal pressure when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two figure # shows the data on a silicone fluid labeled ##### cps which gave a high positive normal pressure 
a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time a back pressure was then introduced and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure 
the actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes with molecular weights which were stated to be ### and ### 
the maximum suction was ### of test fluid measured from the top of the block and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids it is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus 
however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures 
the elasticity is a parameter of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a parameter which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as printing inks paints adhesives molten plastics and bread dough for the elasticity is related to those various properties termed length shortness spinnability etc which are usually judged by subjective methods at present 
if the volume is the molal volume then af is obtained on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists although the af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects 
if af is the change per unit volume in gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant p and t and **yr is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is af af is the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h 
the minimum total potential energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to h and equating to zero this gives af which is the pressure 
this method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields the relation between osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be developed in an analogous way 
this can be justified thermodynamically in this case and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by philippoff that the deformational mechanics of elastic solids can be applied to flowing solutions 
if the mechanics are similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar the concept of the strain energy as a gibbs function difference af and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies of fluids undergoing shear 
according to philippoff the recoverable shear s is given by af where **yc is the angle of extinction from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the af calculated from the pressure normal to the shearing face 
these droplets are distorted by the normal forces just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in ones hands these droplets appear to be ellipsoids and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are 
the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoids mason and taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoids is at ##degrees at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear 
 this is of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence studies the relative forces can be calculated from the various radii of curvature if we assume a the surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop 
 c the kinetic effects are negligible  d since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid 
just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is af the pressure exerted by any curved surface is af where **yg is the interfacial tension and af and af are the two radii of curvature this formula is given by rumscheidt and mason 
there are no data published in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas however there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate viscosity ### poises suspended in corn syrup of ## poises in a paper by mason and bartok 
measurements on the photograph in this paper give af at the maximum rate of shear of af if it is assumed that the formula given by lodge of cosec af applies the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension can be calculated 
this appears to be high as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drops it is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous to rubberlike deformation 
in other words if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant temperature the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink this means that work equals q which in turn equals af 
this conformational entropy is in this case equal to the usual entropy for there are no other changes or other energies involved note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure 
a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented af is paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects lead to line broadening 
an isotropic resonance shift of af to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction the general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment af of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and is specialized to af 
the experimental second moment af conforms to the relation af in agreement with theory hence the electron paramagnetic effects slope can be separated from the nuclear effects intercept 
the nuclear dipole effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the symmetry of the af bond in af remains in doubt the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei 
af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters since it is a normal paramagnet with three unpaired electrons on the chromium its crystal structure is very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong af bond provides structural interest we first discuss the af bond in af 
indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects the information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various motionalmodified models of the af bond in af 
moreover it will be asymmetric until a certain critical af distance is reached below which it will become symmetric there is ample evidence from many sources that the af bond in af is symmetric 
there is evidence though less convincing than for af that the af bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric a number of semiempirical estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the af bond becomes symmetric when the af bond length is about ## to ## a but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports of symmetric af bonds 
he finds the structure contains an af bond with the af distance of af there is then the possibility that this af bond is symmetric although douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his xray data 
xray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of af the xray data did not permit douglass to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry 
this space group requires the hydrogen bond to be symmetric douglass found powder intensity calculations and measurements to agree best for af 
the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each cr atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of o atoms the af layers are stacked normal to the ### axis with the lower oxygens of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers 
a drawing of the structure is to be found in reference # the gross details of the structure appear reasonable 
the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal however the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off af but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent with af at af and af at af space group af where af represents the oxygens on one side of the af layers and af those on the other side 
hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions along the ### axis 
 # all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other  # hydrogen atoms are asymmetrically placed either randomly or in an ordered way so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms 
a randomization of ups and downs is more likely than ordered ups and downs in position # since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since ordered up and down implies a larger unit cell for which no evidence exists therefore the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically # or asymmetrically # 
dr douglass was kind enough to lend us about # grams of his material this material proved to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible results on various portions of the sample 
since af is ferromagnetic we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically contaminated af would be suspect plane suggested another preparation of af which we used here 
a very fine gray solid about ## g is formed waterwashed by centrifugation and dried at ###degreesc differential thermal analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at ###degreesc and a large endothermic reaction at ###degreesc 
thermogravimetric analysis showed a weight loss of ##% centered at ###degreesc and another weight loss of ###% at ###degreesc the expected weight loss for af going to af and af is ###% 
the small reaction occurring at ###degreesc is probably caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than af all subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to ###degreesc for one hour 
chromium analysis gave ###% cr as compared with ###% theory however af adsorbs water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss 
magnetic analyses by r g meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic impurities af was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electrons per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of af where af 
an infrared spectrum obtained by h a benesi and r g snyder of this laboratory showed bands in the positions found by jones electron microscopic examination of the af sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about ##m in diameter 
the xray data are consistent with particle sizes of #### a or greater we found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron microscopic examination 
one measurement at ## mc/sec was obtained with the varian model af unit a bridgedt type of bridge was used in the ## ## mc/sec range 
a modulation frequency of ## cps with an amplitude as small as possible commensurate with reasonably good signaltonoise quality was used the spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mixed in with the absorption signal 
the value of af estimated at ### gauss was af microseconds a single measurement of the spin spin relaxation time af was obtained at ## mc/sec by pulse methods 
field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined as the field about which the first moment is zero second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration 
spectra were obtained over the temperature range of ## ###degreesk for the lowtemperature measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and eades 
one sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at ###degreesc showed the presence of adsorbed water about ## wt as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared due to broadening at low temperature the data reported here are either from spectra from which the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples evacuated and sealed off at ###degreesc which contain no adsorbed water 
such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of about af spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a heighttodiameter ratio of # 
spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube the bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary 
this sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to that described above polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants were a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphates spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited 
the best known field of application for builders is in heavyduty spraydried detergent formulations for household use these widely advertised products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on highsudsing synthetic organic actives sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates and contain up to ##% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate 
lightduty synthetic detergents with much less builder and the dwindling builtsoap powders as well as soap flakes and granules none of which are now nationally advertised 
hardsurface cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of alkaline products # the formulations made expressly for machine dishwashers and # the generalpurpose cleaners used for walls and woodwork the better quality products in both of these lines contain phosphate builders 
these hardsurface cleaners are discussed in chapter ## cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces 
an oversimplified differentiation between soft and hardsurface cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved one gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of af 
even here there is room for some variation for metal surfaces vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical reactivity spring used a brush surfaceanalyzer in a metalcleaning study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending upon surface roughness 
exclusive of esthetic values such as high or lowfoam level perfume content etc the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic actives are simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal 
a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many washings whereas with a poor formulation the clothes exhibit a buildup of tattletale grey and dirty spots sometimes with bad results even after the first wash 
harris has indicated that two devices the launderometer and tergotometer are most widely used for rapid detergent testing and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use 
in this way numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance whiteness of the cloth swatches before and after washing soil redeposition is evaluated by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones 
large numbers of potential builders have been investigated but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice the problems of hardsurface cleaning are not nearly as complex 
indeed when the proper inorganic constituents are employed practically any wetting or surfaceactive agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hardsurface cleaning formulation hydroxides orthophosphates borates carbonates and silicates are important inorganic ingredients of hardsurface cleaners 
the importance of the inorganic constituents in hardsurface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present this section attempts to present briefly an uptodate picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces 
dirt which is here defined as particulate material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties greasy soils which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats esters of glycerol with longchain organic acids 
miscellaneous soils which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue the dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically held by surface irregularities to some extent 
this is a theoretically complicated dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles or to stick to an uncharged surface obviously if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is not the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced 
in addition dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids including liquid greases greases stains and miscellaneous soils are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface 
in an essentially static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surfaceactive agent the washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off the debris and acts to some extent as a dissolving and solvating agent 
and natural waters in addition often contain impurities such as calcium salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove the detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove greasy soils 
as is well known detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the property of forming micelles in solution physicochemical investigations of anionic surfactants including the soaps have shown that there is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration 
 # in the critical micelle region there is a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles which have a degree of polymerization averaging around ## ##  # for anionics these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups the ionized ends face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase 
micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately twofold although the matter has not been unequivocally demonstrated the available data show that micelles in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process 
in the cleaning process sorbed greasy soils become coated in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant then during washing the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase 
substances other than detergent actives also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other contiguous condensed phases this is particularly true of highly charged ions especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes 
thus for aqueous media we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surfaceactive agent and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surfaceactive agent from the equilibrium sorption data which are available it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt especially clay soils so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge 
the negatively charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase this hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic actives in detergency 
the crude picture of the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as af the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale 
cleaned cloth must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil it is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent constituent acting alone are severe 
in the overall process it is difficult to assign a pure role to each constituent of a builtdetergent formulation and indeed there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making up a given commercial organic active 
the photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at ##degrees using light absorbed only by the af in the gas phase with af of af and af of af quantum yields of the order of af have been observed at ##degrees 
it appears possible to set a lower limit of about af for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form af radical the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reactions 
it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbonhalogen bond the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies 
it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine furthermore the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high 
contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure reagents we are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride 
it was then distilled at least three times from a trap at ##degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each distillation the purified product was stored at ##degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal 
to prepare the latter silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing af obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory the silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant product of af which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line 
the radiochlorine was stored at ##degrees in a tube equipped with a break seal liter quantities of mallinckrodt low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated with af and af and illuminated for about ## hours with a #### watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches 
purified inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with a break seal this chlorinecarbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distilled off 
the desired amounts of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off the contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking redistributed to the reaction tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off 
this method in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations of reactants in each of the six cells from a set  the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in pyrex capillary tubing ## mm id and about ## cm long 
both types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately ## atmospheres exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at ###degrees the photochemical reaction cells consisted of ## mm id pyrex tubing ## cm long diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquidglass interfaces and not gasglass interfaces 
the round cells were reproducibly positioned in the light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oilbath through a window two types of light source were used a thousand watt projection lamp and an ah# high pressure mercury arc 
relative incident light intensities were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell 
carrier af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated cells containing gaseous reactants were immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide after titration of the liberated af with af aliquots of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a solutiontype geiger tube 
the fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts / minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts / minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride empirically determined correction being made for the difference in counting efficiency of af in af and af  in studying the liquid phase thermal reaction some ## tubes from ## different manifold fillings were prepared and analyzed 
following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes in addition to the method described in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared by the electrolysis of a af eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange of af with molten af 
no correlation between these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found the reaction rates observed at ###degrees ranged from af of the chlorine exchanged per hour to ## exchanged per hour 
sets of reaction tubes containing ## of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another both gave reaction rates in the range of ## to ## of the chlorine exchanged per hour no detectable reaction was found at room temperature for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to # hours 
the improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings 
in all cases there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of illumination by comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging from ## to ## af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases 
these estimates indicated that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at ##degrees is of the order of magnitude of unity when typical reaction cells to which ## of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated chlorine and phosgene were produced 
 although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate data on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in table # 
the last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of # ### cm distance calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series # where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen 
wyatt and whipple #### which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the earth the radial velocity varies inversely as the particle size a ####mdiameter particle near the orbit of mars would reach the sun in about ## million years 
further the corpuscular radiation ie the solarwind protons must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poyntingrobertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force the poyntingrobertson effect causes the semimajor axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semiminor axis with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move toward the sun 
at one astronomical unit from the sun the earths distance the dust orbits are probably nearly circular if such is the case the particles within a distance of about af of the earth will have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into orbits about the earth 
this effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorites around the earth since there is a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effects there must be a continual replenishment otherwise micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space 
asteroidal collisions are also thought to contribute material it is also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originated from meteoritic impacts upon the moon 
even in the neighborhood of the earth where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude this large discrepancy demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved 
at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less certain there are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite environment 
in addition the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light an estimate of the particle sizes concentrations and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane 
the cores of deepsea sediments and content of collectors in remote regions are valuable in this category the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth 
these instruments are installed on rockets satellites and space probes statistically the most significant data have been collected from the sensors on #### alpha explorer # #### delta # sputnik # and #### eta vanguard # 
many other vehicles with smaller sensitivearea exposuretime products contribute some information the impact rate on #### alpha for ### events was af for particles of mass greater than af dubin #### 
ninety per cent of the ### recorded impacts occurred between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude one may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the earths orbit 
on may ## a very large increase occurred with af of mass between af and af for the next two days the impact rate was af 
the data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux preliminary data from #### eta give an average impact rate of af for masses larger than af for about #### events in a ##day period lagow and alexander #### 
the data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations note that the mass threshold is four times that of #### alpha and that the flux is one fifth as large 
pioneer # recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of ## counts in # hours with detectors sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts the second and third russian space probes indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones 
the calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle parameters is very uncertain many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities 
in the united states most of the sensors are calibrated by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces the russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of ejected material from the sensor 
they quote about the same mass threshold as that of the us apparatus but a momentum threshold about ## times greater there is a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the us microphones are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments are isolated from the skin 
the threshold mass of about af corresponds to a ##mdiameter sphere of density af however the conversion from mass to size is unreliable since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy loosely bound meteorite structure with densities as low as af 
the velocity value used is also open to some question if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the earth only about one third the abovementioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass 
the diurnal variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity the flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data 
from an estimated mass of ## g for a zeromagnitude meteorite the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of #### for each unit increase in magnitude the radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres of density af except for the smallest particles which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solarradiation pressure 
it is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of #### per magnitude in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant the values agree with the data from #### alpha and #### eta 
hence these figures apply immediately above the earths atmosphere the unshielded flux is given in the last column 
of course if there is a dust blanket around the earth the fluxes in interplanetary space should be less than the figures given here note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used 
the older scales were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light the mass scale used in table ## was derived on the assumption that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite permitting the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known cook and whipple #### 
extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers the range of micrometeorites the approximate equation is af where n is the number of af with electron linedensity greater than or equal to af and q is proportional to the mass of the meteorite 
at the fifteenth magnitude af and at the twentyfifth magnitude af these extrapolated fluxes are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the figures in whipples table 
the observational data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension into the micrometeorite region the solarelectromagnetic and corpuscularradiation pressure and the associated poyntingrobertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns 
a measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the earth is obtained from analyses of deepsea sediments and dust collected in remote regions pettersson #### most meteoritic material by the time it reaches the earths surface has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material in its passage through the atmosphere 
this is much higher than the nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx present data indicate an accretion of about af tons per year over the entire globe or about af 
it is the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development resulting in the production of bw weapons systems man may also be injured secondarily by damage to his food crops or domestic animals 
the major reason for this is that it has no quickkill effect the incubation period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect render this weapon unsuitable for handtohand encounter 
thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area 
the biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics 
much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure through natural respiration to aerosolized organisms 
the natural anatomical and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract such as the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi are capable of impinging out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence very small particles however in a size range of # to # microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs 
the relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in table # in considering bw defense it must be recognized that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect 
there are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface 
certain other properties of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are noteworthy in defense considerations the smaller the particle the further it will travel downwind before settling out 
there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens restaurants food stores hospitals etc depending on the organism there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products ie in milk for example 
something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials in the first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological conditions 
this material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which facilitates its sampling and assessment four hundred and fifty pounds was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of ### miles 
the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some ### miles from these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over ##### square miles was covered 
the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much smaller scale is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a nonpathogenic organism an aqueous suspension of the spores of b subtilis var niger generally known as bacillus globigii was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles 
in this test ### gallons of a suspension having a count of af organisms per ml or a total of approximately af spores was aerosolized the spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval vessel cruising two miles offshore and vertical to an onsure breeze 
there was a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and ### per cent relative humidity a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore 
a rough attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and fifteenth floors of a government office building all samplers were operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated for four hours 
this suggests that the sampling period particularly at the more distant locations should have been increased as can be seen from figure # an extensive area was covered by this aerosol 
as can be seen from these dosage isopleths approximately ### square miles was covered within the area sampled it is quite likely that an even greater area was covered particularly downwind 
this was not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol a number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry 
botulinal toxin for example is several thousandfold more toxic by this route than when given per os in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult 
an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious agents that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers such as those causing q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category 
it is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property in this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction 
an aggressor would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity in a target population a solid immunity is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized 
there is a broad spectrum of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made an enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality 
mutants may also be developed with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in identification all of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management 
they do not destroy physical structures as is true of high explosives this may be of overriding importance in considering military objectives 
only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem some of those who question the value of bw have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemics 
they argue further and somewhat contradictorily that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease this is why this approach to bw defense has not been given major attention 
this of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus rickettsia prowazwki over city a and that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom 
in this case then the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic 
one might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack the major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate disseminating devices 
the same delivery vehicles whether they be airplanes submarines or guided missiles should be usable if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city 
a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned the air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are subject to attack 
this is an enormous industry that is subject to sabotage one must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products 
a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies these include lowtemperature ethanol cohn fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses 
abelson and rawson using a stepwise elution scheme fractionated whole sera containing abo and rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose speer and coworkers in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera used a series of gradients for elution from aj 
in the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on deaecellulose using single gradients similar to those described by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the abo and rh systems have been described serum samples were obtained from normal group a group b and group o donors 
one contained complete antibody and had a titer of # ### in saline the second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of # ### in albumin and # #### by the indirect coombs test 
in addition one serum was obtained from a donor r e who had been sensitized # years previously this serum exhibited titers of # ## in albumin and # ### by the indirect coombs test 
antia and antib activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o donors by the following tube agglutination methods one drop of each sample was added to one drop of a #% suspension of group af or group b red cells in a small af test tube 
the red cells were used within # days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use the mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for # aj 
for the albumin method equal volumes of ##% bovine albumin sample and #% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for # hr and then were centrifuged at #### rpm for # aj all samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods 
homozygous and heterozygous af cells af and homozygous and heterozygous af cells were used to test each sample however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous af and homozygous af cells will be presented here 
the saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect coombs test in the following manner the cells were washed three times with saline antihuman serum was added the cells were resuspended and the mixture was centrifuged at #### rpm for # min and examined for agglutination 
those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type were selected for use in the present study the red cells for the rh antibody tests were used within # days after drawing except for the af cells which had been glycerolized and stored at ##degreesc for approximately # year 
the cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to #% in saline blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for # hr centrifuged and the serum was removed 
this buffer ph ## was #### m in af and #### m in trishydroxymethylaminometha tris after dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a af cm column of eeaecellulose equilibrated with starting buffer 
the small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately # ml of starting buffer centrifuged resuspended in ## ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity the chromatography was done at #degreesc using gradient elution essentially according to sober and peterson 
the other a shallow concave gradient fig # was produced with a socalled conesphere apparatus the cone being a #liter erlenmeyer flask and the sphere a #liter roundbottom flask each initially contained #### ml of buffer 
a flow rate of ## af was used and ## ml fractions were collected approximately ### fractions were obtained from each column 
for protein identification fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at #degreesc or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at #degreesc by surrounding the apparatus with ice 
paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a spinco model r cell using barbital buffer ph ## ionic strength #### at room temperature on whatman #mm filter paper five milliamperes/cell were applied for ## hr after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a spinco analytrol 
at the end of the run the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried stained for # hr washed and dried while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at #degreec the unstained strips were then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands 
fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for ## hr in the cold against at least ### volumes of phosphatebuffered saline ph ## ionic strength #### they were then centrifuged at ##### pm for ## to ## min at ##degreesc in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of ### to ###% 
for preparative ultracentrifugation fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of # ml or less transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to ## ml with isotonic saline ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at ##### rpm for ### to ### min refrigeration being used throughout the run 
the insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity regardless of the blood group of the donor with either of the gradients described chromatography on deaecellulose separated agglutinins of the abo series into at least three regions figs # and # one of extremely low anionic binding capacity one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity 
when the early part of the gradient was flattened either by using the gradient shown in fig # or by allowing the conesphere gradient to become established more slowly region # activity could sometimes be separated into two areas donors p j and r s fig # and e m fig # the latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak region #a between regions # and # 
moreover after concentration using negative pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated #a donors p j d a and j f fig # not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas 
this was particularly noticeable in group a and group b sera in which cases activity in regions # and # was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all there appeared to be no difference in the distribution of antia and antib activity in group o serum though in two group o donors j f and e m only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity figs # and # 
these fractions were tested for abo agglutinin activity using fractions from group ab plasma as a control as expected most of the activity was found in fraction af with slight activity seen in fraction ## 
once again both antia and antib activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis similarly both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate having extremely low low and high anionic binding capacity respectively fig # 
the incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions fig # 
the insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity in fact agglutination of af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing only incomplete antibody activity 
when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected apart from the honeybee practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor 
they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well mistake them for lumps of dirt i must add at once that these animals are what we call queens young females that have mated in the previous summer or autumn 
even some of the queens will die before the winter is over falling prey to enemies or disease the survivors emerge on some nice sunny day in march or april when the temperature is close to ##degrees and there is not too much wind 
the blooms of ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble honeybees bumblebees and other wild bees and also various kinds of flies each male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers 
by scrutinizing the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny warts those are the nectaries or honey glands fig ## page ## 
a marvelous arrangement for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed the only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites 
as we have already seen in the first chapter bumblebees are bigger hairier and much more colorful than honeybees exhibiting various combinations of black yellow white and orange let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and let us just call them bombus 
if you really insist on knowing their names an excellent book on the north american species is bumblebees and their ways by o e plath if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she has left her feeding place we may discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep 
most species seem to prefer a readymade hollow such as a deserted mouse nest a bird house or the hole made by a woodpecker some show a definite liking for making their nest in moss 
on this she builds an egg compartment or egg cell which is filled with that famous pollenandnectar mixture called beebread she also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills with honey 
the queen afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen taking a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots when the larvae hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother 
the larvae kept warm by the queen are full grown in about ten days each now makes a tough papery cocoon and pupates 
the first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs males and mating females do not emerge until later in the season 
by the middle of the summer many of the larvae apparently receive such a good diet that it is optimal and it is then that young queens begin to appear simultaneously males or drones are produced mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers although a few may be produced by the queen 
it is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing for instance in august at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the fertilized eggs that will produce females 
the nest itself the structure that in some cases housed about #### individuals when the season was at its peak is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain beetles and moths not always though does the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described 
bumblebees can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of psithyrus the cuckoobumblebee as it is called in some european countries female individuals of psithyrus look deceptively like the workers and queens of the bumblebees they victimize 
the female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host when she succeeds she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the bumblebees seal the egg compartment 
thus the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread later on they and the mother psithyrus are fed by the bombus workers 
but let us return after this gruesome interlude to our willow catkins in the spring there are other wild bees that command our attention 
there are about ### different kinds of andrena in europe alone one of my favorites is a armata a species very common in england where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee 
almost equal in size to a honeybee a armata is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species a rich velvety rusty red after having mated an andrena female digs a hole straight down into the ground forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil 
the development of the andrena larvae is very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults but they are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter 
in the sacramento valley in california for instance it has been observed that there was not one days difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal 
although andrena is gregarious so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together we must still call it a solitary bee its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species 
on the basis of its life history we like to think that andrena is more primitive than the bumblebees the way in which it transports its pollen is not so perfect either 
still andrena will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees 
in the united states department of agricultures yearbook of agriculture #### which is devoted entirely to insects george e bohart mentions a site in utah which was estimated to contain ###### nesting females often the burrows are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres 
in most places there are two generations a year a second brood of adults appearing late in the summer i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias 
the name alkali bee indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places sometimes although by no means always these are indeed alkaline 
yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either the best chance of course is offered by gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits which permit only sparse plant growth 
laurence m klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes and charles c carpenters data on michigan garter and ribbon snakes thamnophis show that the smallest gravid females are more than half as long as the biggest adults felix kopstein states that when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal length but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity 
he was working with species of java so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions 
it is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves there seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest boa constrictor and ending with the largest anaconda 
for four of the six the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor being the smallest and the indian python the next in size at the former stage let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda 
when it comes to rate of early growth the indian python leads with a figure of about # feet # inches per year for the first two years more or less the african rock python a close second is followed in turn by the reticulate python 
it seems likely that the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep 
at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions 
the best way to determine the correct figure in captives is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth a method that produced surprising results maturing of a male indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three data on the boa constrictor about match this 
results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations about three years are required there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity of data 
oliver in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition to the rattlers which i shall consider separately these three were much alike lined snake tropidoclonion one year and nine months 
klauber investigated the rattlesnakes carefully himself and also summarized what others have found he concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three 
carpenters study showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of michigan mature at about the age of two oversized monsters are never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimensions 
every snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer in spite of all the pitfalls there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants 
the relatively wild conditions still found in tropical south america might be responsible there are three levels on which to treat the subject 
the next level attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated 
the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again or even of ghosts that chase people out of graveyards the mere piling up of testimony does not prove to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snakes joint snakes or ghosts 
bernard heuvelmans also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda he reasons that as anacondas ## feet long are often found some might be ## and occasional monstrous freaks over ## 
his thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents with prodigious strength but these seem to be given to complete his picture not to be believed detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows 
rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage and maximum length with confirmation or amplification of olivers figures 
at birth this species varies considerably in size a brood of twentyeight born at brookfield zoo near chicago ranged in length from ## to ###/# inches and averaged ## inches 
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the brookfield brood and its average raymond l ditmars had two broods that averaged ## inches 
william beebe reports ## inches and ## ounces this snake must have been emaciated for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana in contrast ditmars recorded the average length of seventytwo young of a ##foot female as ## inches and four young were born in london at a length of ## or ## inches and a weight of from ## to ## ounces 
a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size i have little information on the anacondas rate of growth 
it is very unlikely that either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate in #### afranio do amaral the noted brazilian herpetologist wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes 
thus his estimate lies between olivers suggestion of at least ## feet and the ##foot monstrous freaks intimated by heuvelmans the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond oil company and reported in #### by emmett r dunn 
olivers ###/# feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable however many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about ## feet 
in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of subspecies a colombian females brood of sixteen boa constrictors born in the staten island zoo averaged ## inches 
the range is from ## to ## inches the former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central american female see chapter on laying brooding hatching and birth the latter on a normal newly born individual 
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods from definite localities alphonse r hoges measurements of several very young specimens from brazil suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male 
carl kauffeld has written to me of sexual activity in february #### of young born in march #### one female collected on an island off the coast of nicaragua was gravid and measured # feet # inches from snout to vent her tail should be between # and # inches long 
what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate unfortunately no one has kept complete records of one individual whereas many have been made for a very short period of time 
the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout the pulmonary vein however without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type # follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship figs # ## 
the bronchial artery except for a small number of short branches in the hilum contributes none of the pleural blood supply it does as in type # supply the hilar lymph nodes the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the bronchioles terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole 
lung type # fig # is to some degree a composite of types # and # it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules 
the most distal airways are similar to those found in type # being composed of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional poorly developed respiratory bronchioles figs ## ## in this instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type # 
distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type # fig ## this relationship however is not maintained centrally 
the bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals as seen in types # and # it supplies the hilar lymph nodes vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles 
this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once 
with completion of filling netlike anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted 
the diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum figs ## ## ## in distal regions its diameter would be onefourth to onefifth that of the pulmonary artery 
also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted via the pleura and along the terminal bronchiole figs ## ## ## ## 
it is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an interspecies comparison is made the significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined 
the volume and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse also interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow 
and in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent van allen and lindskog ## a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present 
for example the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate long alveolar ducts and short large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types # and # one might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse 
anatomically the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others birnbaum ## in the human being the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries 
in #### this was reaffirmed by cudkowicz the opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of miller ## 
although miller noted in #### that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat miller ## the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear 
the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues theoretically they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ghoreyeb and karsner ## or from pulmonary arterial blood comroe ## 
if this be true the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema one would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types # or # 
nakamura ## verloop ## marchand gilroy and watson ## von hayek ## and tobin ## have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being miller ## is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint 
as early as #### ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure berry brailsford and daly in #### and nakamura in #### reaffirmed this 
it is distinctly possible therefore that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence uninjectable this viewpoint is further supported by verloops ## demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves 
in addition little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial arterypulmonary artery anastomoses ## found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats 
nakamura ## was unable to demonstrate their existence either by anatomic or physiologic methods in dogs the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is speciesdependent is therefore inferred 
it is however highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial arterypulmonary artery shunts in certain species especially the dog in conclusion these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lungs 
also for the present great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man this is especially so if the dog cat or monkey are to be used in view of their marked anatomical differences from man 
the main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented a tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types 
type # by the dog cat and monkey lobularity is extremely well developed in type # 
the pleura is extremely thin in type # and septa are absent arterial supply to the pleura in types # and # is provided by the bronchial artery and in type # by the pulmonary artery 
in type # the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types # and # although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present 
in type # the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum this may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present 
some of the features of the top portions of figure # and figure # were mentioned in discussing table # first the onset profile spreads across approximately ## years for boys and ## years for girls 
the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence second for both sexes the ## transverse lines in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile 
third the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls a fact which confirms data for other groups of children the onset profile and completion profile are constructed to serve as norms for children 
when a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line the moderate rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age such classifications may be called somewhat advanced or somewhat delayed as the case may be reserving moderate for dots upon or close to the mean 
there the middle one of the three curves denotes mean skeletal age for the maturity series boys and girls the upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation 
to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers first the upper portion requires series of films for every child consisting of those from hand elbow shoulder knee and foot 
second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones of the five regions the lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly since only two long bones are included in hand and wrist as a region 
the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset and completion fourth the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center 
onsets completions and skeletal ages hand of boy ## and girl # may be directly compared and classified using only those skeletal ages which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body 
it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings but there is substantial agreement since a skeletal age rating can be made at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood 
such an indicator or indicators are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress it was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the ## growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables # and # 
the differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows the data for boy ## appear in figure # and for girl # in figure # 
the dot on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the childs onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center the tip of the arrow represents extent of difference between the childs completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center 
the direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at completion from the level at onset when the dot and tip coincide the classification used in this paper is same schedule 
the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in figures # and # this difference is readily clarified by referring to table # 
for the boy this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion thus the span of its ossification was shortened and the centers ability to catch up in ossification is demonstrated 
obviously the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between onset and completion the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure # shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period 
we have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child more than #### values for the entire group by constructing figures for each of the ## centers so that the data for all ## boys and ## of the girls will appear together for each growth center figures # and # are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center 
the principles used in making each arrow for figures # and # were applied to the construction of figures # and # as well as all figures in the appendix one growth center in a short bone distal phalanx of the second finger was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because epiphysealdiaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage 
the following summary based on figures # and # is an example of one way of interpreting the ## figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center at the top of figure # for example the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in table # 
the growth center depicted here in the distal phalanx of the second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones the mean onset age was ### months table # and the average span of the osseous stage was ### months 
with due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing expected rate of change in ossification of girls age # years and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement each arrow with a shaft length of four months or less was selected as indicating same schedule at onset and completion for this particular epiphysis accordingly girls ## ## ## ## ## ## # # ## ## ## ## ## ## # ## ## and ## may be said to have the same schedule at onset and completion 
accordingly if epiphysealdiaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the ## girls with same schedule as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure girl # had a delayed onset and further delayed completion 
a similar analysis of figure # for the ## boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage boys ## ## ## ## ## ## and ## had same schedule at onset and completion

however the formation of organically bound iodine mainly monoiodotyrosine can be accomplished in cellfree systems in the absence of additions to the homogenate the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein fawcett and kirkwood #### 
taurog potter tong and chaikoff #### this iodoprotein does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cellfree systems 
if tyrosine and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cellfree homogenate of the thyroid large quantities of free monoiodotyrosine can be formed alexander #### it is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue 
in the thyroid gland it appears that proteins chiefly thyroglobulin are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated iodination of tyrosine however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone 
the mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with nonenzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain diiodotyrosine analogues pittrivers and james #### there is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is under enzymatic control 
little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cellfree systems nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in vitro been unequivocally proven 
similar findings have been noted in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzymes whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide in addition depending on availability of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine 
the presence of several proteases and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid one of the proteases has ph optimum of about ## and another of about ## mcquillan stanley and trikojus #### 
the finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in thyroid glands from tshtreated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo there is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly purified form nor is their specificity known 
besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses deiodinating enzymes a microsomal deiodinase with a ph optimum of around # and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity has been identified in the thyroid stanbury #### 
it is assumed that the iodine released from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid where it is oxidised and reincorporated into thyroglobulin the thyroxine and triiodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping deiodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream 
it has been suggested that the plasma thyroxinebinding proteins which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ingbar and freinkel #### one type has a small univalent anion of the thiocyanateperchloratefluoro type 
it does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such the other group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil 
the mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin astwood #### on the other hand there are a few antithyroid drugs of this same general type such as resorcinol possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine 
the anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased output of tsh causing the thyroid to enlarge the effect of drugs that act on the iodideconcentrating mechanism can be counteracted by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet 
besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol types certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods the most conclusively identified is l#vinyl#thiooxazolidone which was isolated from rutabaga greer #### 
there is some evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia clements and wishart #### there it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen which is then secreted in the milk 
in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and increased thyroid activity money rall and rawson #### stanbury brownell riggs perinetti itoiz and del castillo #### 
with lower levels thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid bloodflow enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake of iodine further the gland is able to reuse a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone deiodinated peripherally 
this appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin if the deficiency persists long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the af label will reflect the af distribution in the thyroglobulin 
the name thyroidstimulating hormone tsh has been given to a substance found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so tested for its presence the hormone has also been called thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone 
here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of tsh in blood brown #### has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying tsh and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject 
this connection was clarified by smith and smith #### who showed that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could reactivate the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles the first attempts to isolate tsh came a decade later when janssen and loeser #### used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh from insoluble impurities 
albert #### has concluded that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period from #### to #### were probably about ### to ### times as potent as the starting material much of this work has been reviewed by white #### and by albert #### 
in the last few years the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the problem of isolating tsh has led to further purification bates and condliffe #### pierce carsten and wynston #### 
two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood first is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored 
it is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood tsh is to be discussed rationally the importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent observation that there exists an abnormally longacting tsh in blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients adams #### 
in evaluating data on the concentration of tsh in blood one must examine critically the bioassay methods used to obtain them the introduction of the united states pharmacopoeia reference standard in #### and the redefinition and equating of the usp and international units of thyroidstimulating activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time 
for the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard the international unit u adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different laboratories mussett and perry #### has been defined as the amount of activity present in ### mg of the international standard preparation 
muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroidinduced weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups 
this patient was a ##yearold white male accountant who entered the new york hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on june ## #### because of disabling weakness and general debility in #### the patient developed an unexplained anemia for which ## blood transfusions were given over a period of # years 
no additional transfusions were necessary after the institution of prednisone in july #### in an initial dose of ## mg daily with gradual tapering to ## mg daily this medication was continued until february #### 
additional findings at this time included cardiomegaly peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans and cholelithiasis later chlorothiazide and salt restriction became necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure 
in september #### the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia in an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component triamcinolone ## mg daily was begun on sept ## #### and continued until feb ## #### 
by nov # #### weakness specifically involving the pelvic and thigh musculature was pronounced and a common complaint was difficulty in stepping up on to curbs prednisone ## mg daily was substituted for triamcinolone from nov ## until dec # #### without any improvement in the weakness 
triamcinolone ## mg daily was resumed and maintained until feb ## #### chlorothiazide was omitted for a #week period but there was no change in the muscle weakness 
electromyography revealed no evidence of lower motor neuron disease the proteinbound iodine was ## mg and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was ##% in ## hours with a conversion ratio of ##% 
in february #### during the second admission to the new york hospital a biopsy specimen of the left gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was ## units per ml per min 
on feb ## #### purified corticotropin acth gel ## units daily intramuscularly was started but had to be discontinued # weeks later because of excessive fluid retention from march # to may # #### the patient was maintained on dexamethasone # to # mg daily 
muscle weakness did not improve and the patient needed first a cane then crutches in spite of normal thyroid function tests a trial of propylthiouracil ### mg daily for one week was given but served only to intensify muscle weakness 
these reactions were interpreted as being manifestations of hypoadrenocorticism severe back pain in june #### prompted a third hospital admission 
a highprotein diet calcium lactate supplements and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness the terminal hospital admission on june ## #### was necessitated by continued weakness and debility complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids 
on july # #### the patient developed marked abdominal pain and distension went into shock and died the body was that of a welldeveloped somewhat debilitated white man weighing ### lb 
the heart weighed ### gm and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured ## and # mm respectively the coronary arteries were sclerotic and diffusely narrowed throughout their courses and the right coronary artery was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque ## cm distal to its origin 
the valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflets microscopically sections from the posterior base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue 
many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied and had large irregular basophilic nuclei the intima of the larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells 
in particular the orifices of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded and both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded on the surfaces of both lungs there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to # cm in diameter 
microscopically there was emphysema fibrosis and vascular congestion macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen in some of the alveoli and the intima of some of the small arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue 
the endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin some of the sinusoids contained large numbers of nucleated red cells and cells of the granulocytic series were found in small numbers 
microscopically there was hyperemia of the central veins and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma some liver cord cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm while others had small amounts of brown hemosiderin pigment 
the mucosa of the stomach was atrophic and irregularly blackened over a ## cm area the small and large intestines were filled with gas and the jejunum was dilated to about # times its normal circumference 
a careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessels microscopically the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive cytolysis and contained large numbers of gramnegative bacterial rods 
some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi and there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage a section of the colon revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils 
the kidneys were pale and weighed right ### gm and left ### gm the surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear fluidfilled cysts measuring up to # cm in diameter 
microscopically both kidneys showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed with neutrophils 
these changes were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left in addition there were # small papillary adenomas in the right kidney 
the marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and showed areas of fatty replacement microscopically there were many areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity 
the muscles of the extremities chest wall neck and abdominal wall were soft pale and atrophic microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius pectoralis major transversus abdominis biceps brachii and diaphragm showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers 
in the gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers such as that shown in figure # such swollen fibers were deeply eosinophilic contained a few pyknotic nuclei and showed loss of crossstriations obliteration of myofibrils and prominent vacuolization 
as shown in figure # the protoplasm of other fibers was pale granular or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes in association with these changes in the fibers there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei 
in contrast to the nuclear changes described above another change in muscle nuclei was seen usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct crossstriations and myofibrillae the nuclei of these fibers as is shown in figures # and # showed remarkable proliferation and were closely approximated forming a chainlike structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber 
at times clumps of ## to ## closelypacked nuclei were also observed occasionally there were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli fig # 
in all of the sections examined the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal in attempting to improve specificity of staining the fluoresceinlabeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways # they were passed through dowex#chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders coons #### prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by agrobacterium tumefaciens e f smith & townsend on sweet clover stems 
the proteins were extracted with # volumes of af in af to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by ##% saturation with af the precipitate was washed twice with an ##% saturated solution of af dissolved in a small quantity of ## m neutral phosphate buffer dialyzed against cold distilled water till free from ammonium ions and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen 
 # the conjugates were passed through a diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer pbs containing af potassium phosphate and af the technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by coons et al #### 
the sections were mounted on cold slides smeared with haupts adhesive johansen #### in earlier experiments and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by schramm and rottger #### the latter adhesive was found to be much more satisfactory 
until used they were stored for as long as # weeks the sections were fixed in acetone for ## minutes and dried at ##degrees for ## minutes 
as controls other sections were similarly covered with aj sections were then washed with pbs for ## ## minutes 
after blotting out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine # parts glycerine to # parts of pbs after drying the sections under the fan fixing in acetone and drying at ##degrees as in the indirect method the sections were treated with conjugated af or af undiluted unless mentioned otherwise for # ## minutes 
the sections were then washed with pbs for ## ## minutes and mounted in buffered glycerine stained or unstained sections were examined under dark field illumination in a zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp osram hbo ### 
in the eyepiece a wratten # b filter was used to filter off residual ultraviolet light a red filter zeiss barrier filter with the code schott designation bg ## was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence 
the intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder sections of sweet clover stem and root tumors were treated with # ## solution of af for ## minutes washed in buffered saline for ## minutes stained with af for ## minutes and washed for ## minutes in aj 
this specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive sections stained with # ## dilution of ns and af or with af alone unstained sections mounted in buffered glycerine or sections treated only with ns or af did not show such green fluorescence 
however the nonspecific staining by the af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen two absorptions of af with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of af which had been passed through dowex#chloride ns and af with crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining 
in all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were diluted to # ## or # ### with ###% saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not appreciably reduced whereas a dilution of the intermediate sera to # ### or diluting the af to # # greatly reduced specific fluorescence rinsing the sections with pbs before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction 
the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate through a deaecellulose column when # ml of conjugate was passed through a column af the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and very little in others 
after these treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellowgreen specific staining with this purified conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with # ## dilution of af for ## minutes washing with pbs for ## minutes staining with af for ## minutes and washing with pbs for ## minutes 
af was first conjugated with ## mg of fitc per gram of globulin this conjugate was passed twice through dowex#chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method 
in later experiments af and af were prepared by conjugating # mg of fitc per gram of globulin these conjugates af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate with ## mg fitc per gram of globulin while the specific staining was similar in both cases 
the best staining procedure with this purified af consisted of staining with the conjugate for ## minutes and washing in pbs for ## minutes the specificity of staining with af was established as follows af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover 
after passing af through deaecellulose the titer of antibodies to wtv in the specific fraction was # # of the titer before such passage precipitin ring tests by r f whitcomb but mere dilution of the conjugate to # # did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining 
specific staining by deaecellulose treated af and af although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography this was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells 
results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of wtv antigen in certain tissues of tumors the virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue 
within the pseudophloem cells the distribution of wtv antigen was irregular in the cytoplasm no antigen was detectable in certain dark spherical areas in most cells 
in some tumor sections small spherical bodies possibly inclusion bodies littau and black #### stained more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen in all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain detectable amounts of wtv antigen 
in the indirect method this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with ns and af or with af only in the direct method af not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems nonspecifically and wtv tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable af 
treatment of the conjugates with ethyl acetate and the conjugates which had been passed through dowex#chloride with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems coons #### 
the reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known in our work the best procedure for removing substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a deaecellulose column and in some cases to absorb the first and second milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder 
a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm woundtumor virus is a leafhopper transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation black #### 
since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the cortex in experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the hypothalamus was demonstrated 
even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey a on seeing monkey b but not a rabbit in emotional stress a previously extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey a and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges 
in addition the neocorticalhypothalamic relations play a great role in primates as mirskys interesting experiment on the communication of affect demonstrates but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex 
it should be added that in man neocorticalhypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory imagination and creativity previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response 
after this brief discussion of neo paleocortical and corticohypothalamic relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and pathological significance facilitatory processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending and descending pathways 
on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored apparently a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex 
this tendency can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or via corticohypothalamic pathways it is believed that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism 
thus a low intensity of hypothalamiccortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness resulting in synchronous eeg potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition moreover the dominance in parasympathetic action with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic at the hypothalamic level induces by its peripheral action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the cortex a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system 
since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes in man and animals 
although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs the latter the tranquilizers 
important as these differences are they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side we produce depressions whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and eventually maniclike changes the emotional states produced by drugs influence the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner 
the shock therapies act likewise on the hypothalamic balance physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges 
this explains the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions and a shift in the reaction from hypo to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the mecholyl test some investigators have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and increasing deviation of this test from the norm 
the mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of correlating autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions additional tests seem to be desirable it was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleepwakefulness cycle 
in both conditions the emotional and perceptual sensitivity is diminished but no depression occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs the fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of parasympathetic and also of sympathetic dominance remain to be elucidated 
a state of parasympathetic tuning of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli but leads also to an autonomic reversal a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response furthermore conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic tuning are observed 
however if these procedures are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily abolished in other studies loss of differentiation in previously established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive metrazol treatments suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes 
 # drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions  # in a state of depression the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing alerting effect on the aj 
on the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapythe foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of emotion 
we pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms particularly in certain types of personality but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion abreaction may cure a battle neurosis this phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses 
wolpes experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area he showed convincingly that anxiety is a learned conditioned reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed therefore that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional and reversible 
in a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding and pain a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding 
even when the intensity of the shocks was increased gradually it failed to evoke any signs of pain since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation wolpe thought that he could utilize the feedingpain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding 
he then applied this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses he took advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude was established 
the feedingpain antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the tropho and ergotropic systems furthermore a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety 
the psychological incompatibility of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based on this marked difference in our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems respectively 
although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems as a first approximation it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent changes in the hypothalamiccortical discharges account for major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions in man and beast under physiological circumstances in experimental and clinical neurosis and as the result of psychopharmacological agents in view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiating mental changes 
we can do this through the characteristic values and vectors of t in certain special cases ie when the minimal polynomial for t factors over the scalar field f into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree # what can we do with the general t 
first t may not have a single characteristic value this is really a deficiency in the scalar field namely that it is not algebraically closed 
the second situation is illustrated by the operator t on af f any field represented in the standard basis by af the characteristic polynomial for a is af and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial for a or for t 
on the other hand the null space of af and the null space of af together span v the former being the subspace spanned by af and the latter the subspace spanned by af and af this will be more or less our general method for the second problem 
the diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which af for each i the theorem which we prove is more general than what we have described since it works with the primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial whether or not the primes which enter are all of first degree 
let t be a linear operator on the finitedimensional vector space v over the field f let p be the minimal polynomial for t af where the af are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over f and the af are positive integers 
 b each af is invariant under t  c if af is the operator induced on af by t then the minimal polynomial for af is af 
the projection af will be the identity on af and zero on the other af we shall find a polynomial af such that af is the identity on af and is zero on the other af and so that af etc 
thus there are polynomials af such that af note also that if af then af is divisible by the polynomial p because af contains each af as a factor 
since af and p divides af for af we have af thus the af are projections which correspond to some directsum decomposition of the space v 
it is clear that each vector in the range of af is in af for if **ya is in the range of af then af and so af because af is divisible by the minimal polynomial p conversely suppose that **ya is in the null space of af 
but then it is immediate that af ie that **ya is in the range of af this completes the proof of statement a 
if af is the operator induced on af by t then evidently af because by definition af is # on the subspace af this shows that the minimal polynomial for af divides af 
thus af is divisible by the minimal polynomial p of t ie af divides af it is easily seen that af divides g 
if af are the projections associated with the primary decomposition of t then each af is a polynomial in t and accordingly if a linear operator u commutes with t then u commutes with each of the af ie each subspace af is invariant under u in the notation of the proof of theorem ## let us take a look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for t is a product of firstdegree polynomials ie the case in which each af is of the form af 
by theorem ## d is a diagonalizable operator which we shall call the diagonalizable part of t the reader should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that af and in general that af 
let n be a linear operator on the vector space v we say that n is nilpotent if there is some positive integer r such that af 
suppose that the minimal polynomial for t decomposes over f into a product of linear polynomials then there is a diagonalizable operator d on v and a nilpotent operator n in v such that a af b af 
we have just observed that we can write af where d is diagonalizable and n is nilpotent and where d and n not only commute but are polynomials in t now suppose that we also have af where d is diagonalizable n is nilpotent and af 
thus d and n commute with any polynomial in t hence they commute with d and with n 
since d and d are both diagonalizable and they commute they are simultaneously diagonalizable and af is diagonalizable since n and n are both nilpotent and they commute the operator af is nilpotent 
 actually a nilpotent operator on an ndimensional space must have its t power # if we take af above that will be large enough 
 now af is a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent such an operator is obviously the zero operator 
but then since the operator is diagonalizable the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root hence af and the minimal polynomial is simply x which says the operator is # 
then every linear operator t in v can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator d and a nilpotent operator n which commute these operators d and n are unique and each is a polynomial in t 
for vector spaces over nonalgebraically closed fields we still need to find some substitute for characteristic values and vectors it is a very interesting fact that these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter 
we have chosen to give it at the end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus is not purely linear algebra in the primary decomposition theorem it is not necessary that the vector space v be finite dimensional nor is it necessary for parts a and b that p be the minimal polynomial for t 
let n be a positive integer and let v be the space of all n times continuously differentiable functions f on the real line which satisfy the differential equation af where af are some fixed constants if af denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions then the space v of solutions of this differential equation is a subspace of af 
let us now regard d as a linear operator on the subspace v if we are discussing differentiable complexvalued functions then af and v are complex vector spaces and af may be any complex numbers 
if af is the null space of af then theorem ## says that af in other words if f satisfies the differential equation af then f is uniquely expressible in the form af where af satisfies the differential equation af 
this reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra ie by the primary decomposition theorem to describe the space of solutions to af one must know something about differential equations 
however one does not need to know very much it is very easy to establish by induction on r that if f is in af then af 
thus f satisfies af if and only if f has the form af accordingly the functions af span the space of solutions of af 
some experiments are composed of repetitions of independent trials each with two possible outcomes the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another 
we begin with a few examples of binomial experiments a trained marksman shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions may hit the bullseye from # to # times 
what can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of bullseyes in litters of eight mice from similar parents the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from # to # 
when three dice are tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of aces is # or # or # or # more generally suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials that each trial results in either a success or a nonsuccess failure and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial 
in general any outcome we choose may be labeled success the major question in this chapter is what is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials 
fortunately a general formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind before deriving this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this kind 
in the marksmanship example a trial consists of one round shot at a target with outcome either one bullseye success or none failure further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a superexperiment composed of several repetitions of the fiveround experiment 
or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed three times each toss is a trial and the three tosses form the experiment mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times 
ten students act as managers for a highschool football team and of these managers a proportion p are licensed drivers each friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck 
considering only these fridays what is the probability that the coach had drivers all # times note that there are # trials of interest 
the # possible outcomes on each trial are driver or nondriver since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of different trials are independent 
we now generalize these ideas for general binomial experiments for an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment it must have four properties # there must be a fixed number of trials # each trial must result in a success or a failure a binomial trial # all trials must have identical probabilities of success # the trials must be independent of each other 
we also give for each property an example where the property is absent the language and notation introduced are standard throughout the chapter 
for the marksman we study sets of five shots af for the mice we restrict attention to litters of eight af 
here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number each of the n trials is either a success or a failure 
these words are more expressive than labels like a and nota it is natural from the marksmans viewpoint to call a bullseye a success but in the mice example it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse 
sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes ace and notace we classify mice as straighthaired or wavyhaired but a hairless mouse appears 
each die has probability af of producing an ace the marksman has some probability p perhaps ## of making a bullseye 
during a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles the marksman lowering his chance of a bullseye strictly speaking this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials 
experimentally we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another a family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains and a coin is tossed to decide 
when this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent indeed the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family 
each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize voting for one picture may be called success for the other failure 
in repetitions of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors the table shows that ## of the boys and ## of the girls vote for picture a 
thus in independent voting af or ### of the couples would agree but table ## shows that af or ### agree too many for independent voting 
we want to study the probability function of this random variable for example we are interested in the number of bullseyes not which shots were bullseyes 
for example the marksman gets # shots but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first bullseye that is # # # # # or # if he gets no bullseye thus we do not score the number of bullseyes and the random variable is not the number of successes 
obviously very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference  for instance see example # of section ## on red cards in hands of # 
that is we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model a binomial experiment consists of af independent binomial trials all with the same probability af of yielding a success 
the random variable x takes the values af with probabilities af or more briefly af we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n 
the choice of p and n determines the binomial distribution uniquely and different choices always produce different distributions except when af then the number of successes is always # 
binomial distributions were treated by james bernoulli about #### and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called bernoulli trials each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either # or # success 
the several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x the total number of successes which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials the marksman gets two bullseyes one on his third shot and one on his fifth 
the number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values # or # and there are # such random variables here their sum is x the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value af 
these are real analytic periodic functions with period t in the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares 
the latter theorem has been generalized by yamabe and yujobo and cairns to show that in af there are families of such cubes here for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results 
indeed the spiral af with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square the square has one corner point on the straight line segment and does not lie entirely in the interior 
as s increases we consider the two free corner points of the square af and af adjacent to p and q respectively as s approaches t the square will be outside c and therefore both af and af must cross c an odd number of times as s varies from zero to t 
we now have certain squares with three corners on c for any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square 
to each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point ie the corner on c reached first by proceeding along c from the vertex in the direction of increasing t if the vertex is at af and if the interior of c is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating c clockwise through ##degrees about the vertex 
we note that two such curves c and af cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points otherwise being analytic they would coincide at all points which is impossible since they do not coincide near af 
for the vertex at af these values will be denoted by af the function f{t} defined in this way is multivalued 
we will refer to the plane of c and af as the cplane and to the plane of the graph as the aj the graph as a set may have a finite number of components 
each point with abscissa t on the graph represents an intersection between c and af there are two types of such intersections depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection 
any other point of intersection between c and af will be called a tangent point this terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the aj 
we first show that the function is singlevalued in some neighborhood with the vertex at af in the cplane we assume that af is the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and af 
we know that in the cplane both c and af are analytic in the cplane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinates u v with the origin at q and such that both c and af have finite slope at q 
in a neighborhood of q the difference between these functions is also a singlevalued analytic function of u furthermore one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function is monotone for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval 
but af is just the curve af translated without rotation through a small arc for af is always obtained by rotating c through exactly ##degrees the arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve 
it is also seen that af since the change from af to af is accomplished by a continuous translation thus af is also continuous at af and in a neighborhood of af which does not contain a tangent point 
this set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals the fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in lemma # namely that near any tangent point in the cplane the curves c and af are analytic and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point 
in some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the fplane say af the function af is either doublevalued or has no values defined except at the tangent point itself where it is singlevalued a tangent point q in the cplane occurs when c and af are tangent to one another 
there are three possibilities a af remains tangent to c as it is translated  b af moves away from c and does not intersect it at all for af 
the first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the fplane the end points of which fall into category b or c in the second category the function af has no values defined in a neighborhood af 
the same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of af again the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist 
with the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of f first for any value of t for which all values of f{t} are ordinary points the number of values of f{t} must be odd 
therefore for any value of t the number of values of f{t} is equal to the finite number of tangent points corresponding to the argument t plus an odd number the number of ordinary values of the function f{t} at t will be called its multiplicity at t 
then every component of the graph of f must be defined over a bounded subinterval suppose af is defined in the subinterval af 
otherwise by lemma # the component would extend beyond these points further we see by lemma # that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can only change by an even integer 
this is true of all components which have such a bounded support but this is a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every t 
there must be an odd number of such components which will be called complete components the remaining incomplete components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument and are defined only on a proper subinterval of aj 
we again consider a fixed point p at af and a variable point q at af on c we erect a square with pq as a side and with free corners af and af adjacent to p and q respectively 
these svalues are just the ordinary values of af the values af are the ordinary values at af of a multivalued function g{t} which has components corresponding to those of f{t} 
the functions f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t now with p fixed at af afvalues occur when the corner af crosses c and are among the values of s such that af 
we define these values as af and define g{t} in the same way for each t thus we obtain g{t} by introducing an oblique g{t}axis in the aj 
these are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol af then in # we show that any line involution with the properties that a it has no complex of invariant lines and b its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve is necessarily of the type discussed in # 
let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli af and af and let **zg be a af curve of order k on q a general line l meets q in two points af and af through each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus af whose lines are simple secants of aj 
the line af is the image of l we observe first that no line l can meet its image except at one of its intersections with q 
moreover from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of af it is clear that the only points of q at which a line can meet its image are the points of aj hence the totality of singular lines is the t order complex of lines which meet aj 
the order of this congruence is af since af secants of a curve of symbol b on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point the class of the congruence is af since an arbitrary plane meets **zg in k points 
there are various sets of exceptional lines or lines whose images are not unique the most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to q each line of which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line 
it is interesting that a # # correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent for the lines of any plane **yp meeting q in a conic c are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve c into which c is transformed in the point involution on q 
moreover if af and af are two planes intersecting in a line l tangent to q at a point p the two free intersections of the image curves af and af must coincide at p the image of p and at this point af and af must have a common tangent l hence thought of as a line in a particular plane **yp any tangent to q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through l 
this curve is of symbol af since it meets **yl and hence every line of af in the af invariant points on **yl and since it obviously meets every line of af in a single point the congruence of its secants is therefore of order af and class af 
in other words these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all now the only way in which all curves of the image family of af can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of af which is not a secant but a tangent of **zg for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency 
clearly any line l of any bundle having one of these points of tangency t as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of l and q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of af which is tangent to **zg at t a line through two of these points af and af will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the tangents to **zg at af and af as directrices 
hence its image c meets any line of af in af points moreover c obviously meets any line af in a single point 
therefore the congruence of its secants that is the image of a general plane field of lines is of order af and class af finally the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines namely af and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines namely af 
we now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described to do this we must first show that every line which meets **zg in a point p meets its image at p 
by # the image of this pencil is a ruled surface of order af which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve c of order af on c there is a af correspondence in which the af points cut from c by a general line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil 
however since the pencil contains a secant of **zg it actually contains only af singular lines to avoid this contradiction it is necessary that c be composite with the secant of **zg and a curve of order af as components 
but if this is the case then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point p of **zg as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order af having af generators concurrent at p since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent generators is necessarily a cone it follows finally that every line through a point p of **zg meets its image at p as asserted 
from the preceding remarks it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion moreover in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order af namely the cone of secants of **zg which pass through p 
the first possibility requires that there be a line through p which meets **zg in af points the second requires that there be a line through p which meets **zg in af points 
in the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex p to the intersection of **zg and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant in the second the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex p to the two intersections of **zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant 
observations similar to these can be made at each point of aj hence **zg must have either a regulus of affold secants or a regulus of affold secants 
for if such were the case either the plane of the two lines would meet **zg in more than k points or alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high but if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of **zg can intersect then the regulus must be quadratic or in other words **zg must be either a af or a af curve on a nonsingular quadric surface 
for any pencil in a plane containing a affold secant of **zg has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in af lines namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of **zg and the multiple secant plus an additional component to account for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil however if there is no additional complex of singular lines the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely af 
continuing with the case in which **zg is a af curve on a quadric q we first observe that the second regulus of q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of **zg and the planes through any one of the multiple secants for each of these lines meets q in three points namely two points on **zg and one point on one of the multiple secants 
if **ya is the multiple secant of **zg which passes through af and **yb is the simple secant of **zg which passes through af and if af are the points in which **ya meets **zg and if af is the image of af on the generator **yb it follows that the image of the line af is af these societies can expect to face difficult times 
new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction 
feelings of a community of interest will have to be recreated in some of the new nations indeed they must be built for the first time on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past nevertheless with foresight and careful planning some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped 
our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle boldly the tasks which they face at the same time we should recognize that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone to diversions and external adventures of all sorts 
we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene when necessary we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development 
but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forwardmoving world community when we look at countries like iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital and where institutions of centralized government exist we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy 
isolated enterprises have been launched but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern the society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communications between the two 
most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective in these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals 
for example in accordance with the fashion of the times most transitional societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement 
and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice selfdiscipline and competence american policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize of democratize their societies 
above all we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their fates only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can we provide telling assistance 
our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments we should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities state and provincial governments rural communities and other smaller groups making certain that no important segment of the economy is neglected 
efforts such as the community development program in the philippines have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward balanced national development to achieve this goal of balanced development communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account 
land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society 
as part of a larger development effort however it may gain wide acceptance it should also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved by administrative decrees alone 
lastly governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming ahead by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the united states can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve selfsustaining growth 
they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing participation in the program to wider and wider groups 
they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies 
several related tasks must be carried out if selfsustaining growth is to be achieved these countries must formulate a comprehensive longterm program covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors of the economy 
capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment programming to go forward capital flows must be coordinated with national needs and planning 
thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of selfsustaining growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved 
even the famed indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken technical assistance in training middle and upperlevel management personnel is still needed in many cases 
nevertheless impulses still exist among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralized and authoritarian practices another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism 
particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest convinced of the wisdom of their own actions and reassured by the promises of their economic development programs governments may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and inflexible in their policies 
it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies we have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries 
we have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society will take a considerable period of time with the exception of treatymaking foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration 
american and freeworld policies can marginally affect the pace of transition but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which each society must generate 
it must be marked by a patience and persistence which have not always been its trademark this condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy especially in the context of economic aid 
as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it in societies like ours however its place is less clear and more complex 
and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion nevertheless for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies though less for the less religious portion religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions 
if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual is a composed ordered motivated and emotionally secure associate he is not greatly frustrated and he is not anomic 
in the last analysis religion is the means of inducing formulating expressing enhancing implementing and perpetuating mans deepest experience the religious religion seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence 
the chief experience is the sensing of communion and in the higher religions of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered dependable universe 
he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement the universe is a safe and permanent home 
death is not permanent defeat and disappearance he is not lost in the abyss of endless time 
religion can summate epitomize relate and conserve all the highest ideals and values ethical aesthetic and religious of man formed in his culture there is also the possibility among higher religions of experiencing consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and expansiveness 
it also provides facilities and incitements for the development of personality sociality and creativeness under the religious impulse whether theistic or humanistic men have joy in living 
at the same time that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has great therapeutic value for him it gives him aid comfort even solace in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate 
he has to cope with frustration and other emotional disturbance and anomie his religious beliefs provide him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern and his religious faith makes possible fortitude equanimity and consolation enabling him to endure colossal misfortune fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger 
the belief in immortality where held functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here and now the tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less selfcontained or selfsufficient by confession repentance and penance 
in providing for these inner individual functions religion undertakes in behalf of individual peace of mind and wellbeing services for which there is no other institution in addition to the functions of religion within man there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society 
the valuesystem of a community or society is always correlated with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions the religion supports reenforces reaffirms and maintains the fundamental values 
this is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere for example americans rally to christian values visavis those of atheistic communism 
even the nonchurch members the freewheelers marginal religionists and so on have the values of christian civilization internalized in them furthermore religion tends to integrate the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the intermediary and subordinate values 
finally it gives sanctity more than human legitimacy and even through superempirical reference transcendent and supernatural importance to some values for example marriage as a sacrament much lawbreaking as sinful occasionally the state as a divine instrument 
closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends this something leads to a conception of an overall social plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends 
this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their primacy it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action 
in general there is no society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends some of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social groupings have grown out of religion 
the common ultimate values ends and goals fostered by religion are a most important factor without a system of values there can be no society 
it enables members of the society to operate as a system the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in creeds dogmas and doctrines and form what durkheim calls a credo 
the credo unifies and socializes men by attaching them completely to an identical body of doctrine the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the firmer the group 
the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group small or large the common codes for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior bind the devotees together 
the codes are mechanism for training in and directing and enforcing uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity of the group durkheim noted long ago that religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things unites into one single moral community all those who adhere to them 
this is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular semipublic and public occasions in the united states and it is evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious allusions and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds 
the jews for #### years have been a prime example though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion are cases in point it might be pointed out that the integrating function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been identified with other groupings political nationality language class racial sociability even economic 
there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly established to resist change not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices but also in secular affairs having religious relevance it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new ones 
as yinger has pointed out the reliance on symbols on tradition on sacred writings on the cultivation of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the past far more than to the future historically religion has also functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction and perpetuation of various other institutions 
much of the important individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives the great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices 
much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion the insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating effects 
religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control enforcing what men should or should not do among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group 
religion has its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husbands marginal income her defense of denial was excessively strong 
the result dramatically visible in a matter of days in the familys disrupted daily functioning was a phobiclike fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin whose birth had not been anticipated soon mrs bs fears threatened to burst into a fullblown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family 
clearly this was a family in crisis mrs b compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at the time of her mothers death when she was eight as well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying 
on the anniversary of her fathers death she poured out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral in the familys own words during the third of twelve visits they had reached the crisis peak either the situation will give or we will break 
abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss abandonment and annihilation produced further relief of tension in a joint interview mr and mrs b were helped to understand the meaning of a younger sons wandering away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins 
there is room for you too johnnie simultaneously a variety of environmental supports a calm but not too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nursing care accompaniment to the wellbaby clinic for medical advice on the twins feeding problem combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms 
as seen in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance the lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the superficial guise of not knowing or not caring 
in general the approach is more active than passive more outreaching than reflective while some regression is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy 
these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an informationseeking sense 
in so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf 
we are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of denial and crippling guilt turned against the self while some suppression and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the workers clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed 
over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth between immediate external stressful exigencies precipitating stress and the key emotionally relevant issues underlying problem which are often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivated by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they do challenge the workers skill to articulate them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments 
in addition in many cases a variety of concrete social resources homemaker day care medical and financial aid must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts at certain critical stages and only for sound diagnostic reasons it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problemsolving behavior is to be constructive rather than defeating 
finally whatever the techniques used a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we now address ourselves to our final question what place should brief crisisoriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services 
this problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself almost three decades ago bertha reynolds undertook a study of shortcontact interviewing because of her conviction that shortterm casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services 
thus casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended that we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature 
according to a number of studies the important predictors are the nature and management of the clients anxiety as well as the accessibility of the helping person for example the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parentchild relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project 
these reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people similarities to the approach which i have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick appraisal of key issues and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the egos coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses 
in some programs treatment is concentrated over a short period of time while in others after the initial contact is established flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening the worker can withdraw is another prominent feature in these efforts 
though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of shortterm intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary or perhaps in some instances primary level the place of shortterm intervention has already been documented by a number of investigators in a wide variety of settings woodward for example has emphasized the need for a broad spectrum of services including very brief services in connection with critical situations 
moreover the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available and on a more effective basis to more people further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services including attempts to develop a typology of family structures crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment approaches and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in collaboration with community planners 
probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for middlerange efforts that fall short of utopian models increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare services holds rich promise for the future 
tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling one of the devices for tension management is preferential mating 
the relative geographical isolation of the brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society 
the newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship as loomis remarks in the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking friendship and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations 
yet the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war prior to world war # there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after world war # 
the process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population 
core marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions and core negro marriages are proscribed for core members 
there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of nonauthoritative power has been exerted on actors in the system particularly in regard to mate selection this would seem to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal status of that family 
interviews with members of the brandywine population were attempted in order to discover the ranking of the various families in the population the large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions 
 the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages the population has been able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate status in society 
the adherence of many in the population to the indian background in their pedigree and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the selfimage of the intermediate status of the group in society the negative sanctions applied to core negro marriages for core members act as indicators of expected adherence to group norms 
a cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship the comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system and subsystems 
the structural subsystem consisting of relatively stable interrelationships among its parts includes # subgroups of various types interconnected by relational norms 
in the study of marriage patterns for this group consanguinity produces the structural system a system of affinities which in turn maintains the system of consanguinity subgroups of various types have been found within this system 
there seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group additionally the proscription of core negro marriages for core families discussed above would seem to act as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles 
however it cannot be presumed informal though the structure of the population seems that there are not welldefined roles within the system the present study relates to the theory of functional systems 
the four functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by the subsystems within this population by means of geographical isolation and high fertility rates inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained 
to maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not only necessary that members of this population be visible but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct grouping or system in society as mentioned above where families are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and most effective 
this provides the necessary contact with the larger society while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts integration has to do with the interrelation of parts 
the values placed by the brandywine population upon maintaining a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important for the morale of the system since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity the better the system can solve the problems of the system 
it is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation in turn higher fertility rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity 
of particular utility in the analysis of the development persistence and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm 
in discussing the process of communication loomis defines it as the process by which information decisions and directives are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community 
however the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation although the brandywine population is still predominantly rural there are indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities 
this conclusion is however an oversimplification a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urbanfringe area are in general less segregated locally than group members in rural areas 
group pressures toward conformity are slight or nonexistent and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions in such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior 
the process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individuals behavior as well as the groups behavior by means of this social control deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group 
there is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a means of socialization particularly for members of the rural community 
 culturally induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values internalized by members of the group is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of socialization the process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems and the characteristic interaction is maintained 
the fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintaining the boundary  increased boundary maintenance may be achieved for example by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern 
 boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social as is the preference for endogamy it is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural areas 
where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group systemic linkage is defined as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit a royal decree issued in #### two years after the belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms 
in #### a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the governorgeneral and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered but specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors 
the whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in #### general responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs service des affaires indigenes et de la maindoeuvre aimo af direction af direction generale gouvernement generale 
the district officials along with their other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics the regulations require the inscription of each individual male or female adult or child on a separate card fiche 
each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned including his or her date of birth or age at a specified time spouses and children additional entries must be made from time to time 
so a quick count could be made at any time even by an illiterate clerk of the number of registered persons in four ageandsex classes personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments inoculations periods of employment and changes of residence are recorded 
each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand the registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons 
finally the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions numbers of registered persons in four ageandsex classes were counted each year 
the results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general fertility rates distributions by marital status fertility of wives separately in polygynous and nonpolygynous households infant mortality and migration the areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger population 
the scheme in theory is an ingenious adaptation of european registration systems to the conditions of african life but it places a severe strain on the administrative resources already burdened in other ways of a widely dispersed poor and largely illiterate population 
the system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers the distinction between domiciled de jure and present de facto population was not clearly defined 
the system tended to break down during the war but was reactivated it had reached the prewar level of efficiency by #### 
but the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading the same system with minor modifications was developed in ruandaurundi under belgian administration 
before considering more recent activities we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo and ruandaurundi 
this agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from ###### persons in #### to ###### in #### in the kwango district and adjacent areas east of leopoldville each year from #### on its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary objective the incidence of major diseases 
somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas other independent or partially independent agencies have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related to demography 
linstitut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale irsac has sponsored welldesigned field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of ruandaurundi in the development of its official statistics a massive investigation of the characteristics of inmigrants and prospective outmigrants in ruandaurundi is being carried on by j j maquet former director of the social science branch of irsac now a professor at luniversite officielle du congo belge et du ruandaurundi 
statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruandaurundi during the postwar years in connection with longterm economic and social programs the aimo organizations of both countries which maintain administrative services throughout the territories retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information 
a bureau de la demographie a romaniuk director was formed under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the section statistique of the secretariat general eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to the demographic division of the central statistical office 
a member of the irsac staff e van de walle was recently delegated to cooperate with aimo in the development of demographic statistics in this territory the initiation of sampling censuses in ruandaurundi #### and in the congo #### ## were major advances 
the radical nature of the innovation in the congo was not emphasized in the official announcements the term enquetes demographiques previously used for the supplementary investigations carried out in connection with the administrative censuses was used for the new investigations 
these are as follows # field work procedures field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of fulltime african investigators three teams each working in two provinces 
sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling 
sample units villages in rural areas houses in cities were drawn systematically within these strata different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions 
about ## percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation as compared with about # percent in the previous inquiries uniform questions definitions and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country 
in the reports summary results are given for both the de facto a and c and de jure a and b populations but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de jure population or in some districts only the de facto population 
the population registration system still has important functions it supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations 
it also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this source in the near future it is still used in making current population estimates in postcensus years though the value of these estimates is open to question 
even though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date of birth for some of the persons present especially children in relatively stable communities and supplementary information such as records of marital status for many others the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries 
the first sampling census in the congo extended over a threeyear period #### ## the results were still being processed in #### 
it is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses be carried out at fiveyear intervals reports already issued on the sampling census #### ## in various areas run as follows using only the french and omitting corresponding flemish titles 
other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content have been issued these area reports will be followed according to present plans by a summary report which will include a detailed statement on methods 
toward the end of the semesters work he interviewed every married class member at great length he found as he had suspected a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students 
in their own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time in fact they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be at the beginning some hindsight study 
all of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students 
i can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in the past had i been in an allmarried section i would have missed this and i believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me 
but the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction thus the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of #### exclusively for persons already married that is prerequisite marriage 
but only those already married could enroll in this one section in addition two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted 
this action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another 
this has subsequently been verified by the experience in the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged 
besides auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students but in this one section we welcomed auditors 
many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering fields with few electives till the senior year incidentally it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until at last it swelled to such proportions that this free auditing policy had to be retracted 
this experimental class represented quite a variety of students it ranged from a freshman woman just married through the various academic growth stages including one seniorgraduate student to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended 
it ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive one might digress at this point and speculate that if it is wise to create special sections for special status then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage and one for ##yearold men with teenage children and so on 
but few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a premarital situation the writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place 
he did build a framework of academic respectability and one which did not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other existing campus course this is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise children 
but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible a steering committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and reevaluate the direction and pace the class was taking 
but the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes so we are married now how do we make the best of it or how do we enrich our already fine marriage 
our campus unfortunately owns no films since they are all either rented or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance 
for example the steering committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision after of course pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one 
nevertheless the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings though it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group had sprung up within the class 
from a few students this group gradually increased to include over threefourths of those officially enrolled in the class and many outsiders as well also although only a few of the students were intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of that class 
supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group these students although they might read various articles in popular magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the journals 
whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in single sections he can only conclude that there must have been something contagious within the specific group which caused this to occur 
 # a great deal of time was spent on processes for solving marital differences this was not a search for a magic formula but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage 
not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to # specific adjustment areas such as sex inlaws religion finance and so on from here they proceeded to # these same areas in relation to their own future family life stages developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at some time or other 
mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward but the possible death of ones own spouse was not overlooked since the course one member has lost her husband 
but just when was an unknown and of course the longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might not since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis 
these were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them this added a personal zest to class discussions and participation 
the writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before he felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm as a criterion is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think 
on the other hand the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with love as most women seem to do in the reproductive area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in mixed marital status sections 
never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine downtoearth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy there was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented from a childless couple to and including every trimester 
there was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief structuring experience 
this was true mostly of those kohnstammnegative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action responses such as rope with a loop in it and two pieces of rope were quite characteristic 
these were the same subjects who were given the rorschach test some predictions had been made concerning factors r n i and co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity 
one prediction had been made about the difference in security or selfconfidence between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not the nonreactors had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably secure nonreactors and secure reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies 
all of the subjects in the kohnstammnegative and kohnstammpositive groups as defined for purposes of the personality studies were compared with those subjects who shifted in conditions # or # a t test on these two groups shifters vs nonshifters gave a t value of #### which is significant on the twotail test at the
only ##% ## subjects gave a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon there were ##% ## subjects who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration 
among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred one subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax 
four subjects ##% did not change even then but needed the additional information that an armelevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not at no time was it implied by the experimenter that the subjects initial reaction was deviant 
those who responded with an armelevation in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion this information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show armlevitation must be preventing it 
the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition # the naive state is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues in no way either verbally or behaviorally did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction 
a differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstammpositive reactors and yet attribute their naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of normal reactions different from those which they gave 
there was no implication made that their initial reaction absence of an armelevation was less preferred than the presence of levitation a more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as normal 
they were not free to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior instructions to relax ie to be spontaneous and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given 
alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject the only one with whom this technique was tried this subject who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years did not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in this experiment while sober 
there was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement she described herself as having the same kind of irresponsible feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis 
many subjects attributed differences in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control voluntary as the kohnstammpositive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the kohnstammnegative subjects perceived it these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had 
they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors they felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction 
one subject spontaneously asked after her arm had finally risen do you suppose i was unconsciously keeping it down before another said that her arm did not go up at first because i wouldnt let it 
she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing she explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were not letting themselves relax 
in contrast to this voluntarycontrol explanation for nonreactivity given by the kohnstammpositive subjects the kohnstammnegative subjects offered an involuntarycontrol hypothesis to explain nonreactivity they felt that they were relaxing as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level 
but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with armlevitation one kohnstammpositive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows you feel theyre going up and youre on a stage and its not right for them to do so and then you think maybe thats whats supposed to happen 
however she was able to relax and yield to the moment it is our hypothesis that kohnstammpositive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are kohnstammnegative subjects 
it is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the kohnstammpositive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality factor 
there was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline this occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill 
yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be the change in perceptions by some of the kohnstammnegative subjects after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations 
when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present it might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong 
while the interpretations that have been given are inferences only they gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one of the kohnstammnegative subjects who did not on the first trial perceive the tilt illusion it would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated the degree of structure in teaching method 
the unstructured schools were in a large suburban community predominantly middle to uppermiddle class but fringed by an industrial area in order to equate the samples on socioeconomic status we chose schools in both cities on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods 
an objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from these data equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from upperlower and lowermiddle class neighborhoods 
therefore thirdgrade children were chosen as subjects for this study for purposes of sample selection only individual tests were given later we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire thirdgrade population in each school system 
children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total thirdgrade school population were considered underachievers for the purposes of sample selection overachievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression line in their school system 
twentyfour classrooms in twelve unstructured schools furnished ### cases ## boys and ## girls eight classrooms in three structured schools furnished ## cases ## boys and ## girls 
it was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation an interview schedule of openended questions and a multiplechoice questionnaire were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home 
the interviewers were instructed not to suggest answers and as much as possible to record the parents actual words as they described the childs behavior in home situations the rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing the interview records categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records 
children scoring high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals the low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters 
but she cleans it up very well when i remind her castaneda et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for use with children 
there is much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees reliability and validation work with the childrens anxiety scale by castaneda et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale 
the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity the two ratings yield a correlation of which is not significantly different from zero 
in theory compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the obsessivecompulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later 
in establishing criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope beyond the reading act itself the predicted interaction effect should if potent extend its influence over all academic achievement 
all of these subtests involve reading except arithmetic computation scores are stated in gradeequivalents on a national norm 
the wechsler intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample thirdgrade child by a clinical worker the relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a wellestablished fact in this case af 
the criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of over or underachievement it is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the iq 
if a child with an iq of ### scored ## in achievement his discrepancy score would be representing of one year of overachievement a child with an iq of ## would be expected to earn an achievement test score of ## 
in this manner the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables tables # and # present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the descriptive variable 
first of all as we had surmised the highly compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly better af on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools the high compulsive children do better af 
the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported in this case at the level while we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives within the schools where the wholeword method is used in beginning reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives 
we speculate that compulsives in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of systemization in their school setting but that their need to organize for comfort is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment it is interesting to note that medium compulsives in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores although not significantly lower 
our conjecture is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each lesson that aid him in systematizing his work when helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does such a child attain unusual success 
figure # is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group as predicted the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly af than those in the structured schools 
while high anxiety children achieve significantly less well af in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools 
the fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or underachievement these children exhibit the child with high anxiety may first direct his anxietyreleased energy toward achievement but because his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and memorization of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem 
the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination but the symbols he is asked to learn are simple 
success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved by the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words 
sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the testlike situation and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher although the present study was not a direct replication of their investigations the results do not confirm their conclusion 
yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting analysis means the evaluation of subparts the comparative ratings of parts the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements 
up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals 
let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis one should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas 
interviewing checking references training the salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory performance was too high it was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed 
in place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires checking their references interviewing them asking them to be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them each person was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples 
in the testing room he was to make successively three presentations to three different people in the testing room three of the veteran salesmen served as antagonists 
each was told to purchase material if he felt like it the antagonists came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other presentations 
and so did the observers consisting of the president three of his salesmen and a psychologist ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon 
the batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three the president of the firm calculating expenses alone felt his costs had dropped onehalf while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent 
they were in a sense tried out in realistic situations from the point of view of the applicants less time was wasted in being evaluated and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances 
the position of receptionist was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions all applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist 
each girl was independently tested by the personnel man and he served not only as the director but as the antagonist and the observer somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time did the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist showing wit sparkle and aplomb 
in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we are now no longer dealing with a simple overall decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure 
the engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a comer however he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position 
despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him at the insistence of his own supervisor the president of the firm he enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders 
entirely concerned with efficiency he was merciless in criticizing people who made mistakes condemning them to too great an extent he did not really listen to others had little interest in their ideas and wanted to have his own way which was the only right way 
one by one these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors he admitted his behavior and defended it 
after the diagnosing he left the course convinced that it could do him no good we may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment 
we may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills or we may say that his attitude was commendable showing his independence of mind in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others 
another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis in a course for supermarket operators a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly successful as a store manager found that in supervising other managers he was having a difficult time 
he was told he displayed for example a sense of superiority and he answered well i am supposed to know all the answers arent i he was criticized for his curtness and abruptness and he answered i am not working to become popular 
in short as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and defends himself however in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways 
how this was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial problem the director helped tailormake a check list of the district managers errors by asking various observers to write out sentences commenting on the mistakes they felt he made 
eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors they were asked to vote true if they thought they had seen him make the error false if they thought he had not 
the manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard the first eight of these eighteen statements which received at least onehalf of the votes were duplicated to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplayed in other situations the members checked any items that appeared 
after every session the check marks were totaled up and graphed and in this way the supervisors progress was charted in life we learn to play our roles and we freeze into patterns which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do 
to learn what we do is the first step for improvement to accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step 
to practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the fourth step to use these new ways in daily life is the last step 
when an evaluative situation is set up and no concern is with the details that lead to an overall estimate we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion 
while roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents one of the major uses of this procedure the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts 
the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area the reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are twofold 
it is not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patients communicating an introject has appeared and is holding sway one learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone to his voices suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances parrotlike 
only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over from a parent until he experiences it as part of him one hebephrenic woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudoemotion during which despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks i felt only a cold annoyance with her 
at first i did not know what she meant i thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother in their distant homecity 
and when i replied in this spirit she corroborated my hunch at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic motherintroject began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she muttered in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside me 
but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone your father despises you again i at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years deceased 
she looked confused at this and i felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make it then occurred to me to ask is that what that woman told you 
i realized now that she had been showing me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her mother had once said to her it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her 
earlier this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of introjects that at times when she was in her room alone it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice a somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine who used to often seclude herself in her room often sounded through the closed door as i would find on passing by between our sessions for all the world like two persons a scolding mother and a defensive child 
i have found time and again that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis and only when i can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of my personality does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patients behavior 
here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced in their communicative expression to some comparatively simpleseeming verbal or nonverbal statement one finds for example that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and the most unconventional of meanings 
one cannot assume of course that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when the stereotype was uttered probably it is correct to think of it as a matter of a wellgrooved stereotyped mode of expression and no or but a few other communicational grooves as yet being there available for the patients use as newlyemerging emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months 
sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype a how are you now or an i want to go home or whatever but a nonverbal one which reveals itself gradually as the condensed expression of more than one latent meaning 
when the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him what is that bill hello or farewell  the patient replied both dearie two in one 
it is no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients shows as one of his characteristic symptoms laughter laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated which now makes one feel like weeping or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of mans despair and which more often than all these conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another 
in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learns that even these animallike sounds constitute forms of communication in which from time to time quite different things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them in words as i have been intimating in the schizophrenic and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic 
freeman cameron and mcghie in their description of the disturbances of thinking found in chronic schizophrenic patients say in regard to condensation that the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment and the objects contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation in my experience a great many of the patients more puzzling verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated from figurative meanings in his subjective experience 
recently for example a paranoid womans largescale philosophizing in the session about the intrusive curiosity which has become in her opinion a deplorable characteristic of midtwentiethcentury human culture developed itself before the end of the session into a suspicion that i was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast as indeed i was or equally often a concretisticseeming particularisticseeming statement may consist with its mundane exterior in a form of poetry may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speaking 
his subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one one hebephrenic women confided to me i live in a world of words as if to her words were fully concrete objects 
a borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding in a most articulate fashion during session after session with me were like great cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him as he spoke i was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung high in the air from a docked steamship 
a significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized especially for a highly inflected language such as russian for english the reduction in size is less striking 
the logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis 
but first we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood form any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space occurrence an instance of a form in text 
we accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer a randomstorage scheme based on the spelling of forms provides an economical way to compile this textform list 
a location in the computer store is also named for each marked form dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text 
the dictionary is a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries also the dictionary is divided into at least two parts the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms 
text lookup as we will describe it consists of three steps the first is compiling a list of text forms assigning an information cell to each and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence 
cells in the xregion and y region are reserved as information cells for text forms when an occurrence af is isolated during text reading a random memory address af the address of a cell in the xregion is computed from the form of af 
the form itself is stored in the next available cells of the wregion beginning in cell af the address af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in af 
let us assume that af is identical to the form of an occurrence af which preceded af in the text when this situation exists the address af will equal af which was produced from af 
the address af is stored in the cell af when as in this case the two forms match the address af is saved to represent the occurrence af 
thus when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the xregion a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms one cell in the chain for each form if af leads to an address af that is equal to the address computed from af even though af does not match af the chain of information cells is extended from af by storing the address of the next available cell in the yregion af in af 
a third cell can be added by storing the address of another ycell in af similarly as many cells are added as are required 
each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the ycell that is the next element of the chain the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain 
when the information cell for af has been determined it is saved as a representation of af text reading is terminated when a predetermined number of forms have been stored in the textform list 
each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the textform list each time a dictionary form matches a text form the information cell of the matching text form is saved 
these two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage if each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read 
each dictionary form is looked up in the textform list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading a random address af that lies within the xregion of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the ith dictionary form 
the dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms when a match is found an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage 
these two steps essentially complete the lookup operation the final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the textform list and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text 
only the assignment of the information cells is important the first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text 
a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence the grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file 
when entries are being retrieved from this file the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer this selectionrejection process takes place as the file is read 
the address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form  the address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage 
the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents hence the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of textordered informationcell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence 
 here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it two very useful ways for modifying a formdictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form 
the latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents applying the techniques developed at harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once 
equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context thus one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form 
for example the inflected forms of a word can be represented insofar as regular inflection allows by a stem and a set of endings to be attached  indeed the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings 
similarly if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form the dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it 
entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased in sentences patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations of influences that can only be suggested here 
there is a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in longknown hymn tunes thus the first lines of one of charles wesleys hymns are as follows 
in the tune to which this hymn is most often sung boylston the syllables have and fy ending their lines have twice the time any other syllables have dominant stress is of course more than extended duration and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last 
is bills broken a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair from the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement is the predicator has broken and from the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers in the breaking 
in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know 
in the double sentence the smaller the town the friendlier the people it will generally be on the subjects the town and the people dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist 
dominant stress is on her luggage both in thats her luggage where her luggage is the complement and in theres her luggage where it is the subject adverbial second complements however are likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentences 
is george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement the cat not the second complement out final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress 
is george reads the news emotionally dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally when prepositional complements are divided as in what are you looking for 
thus in a context in which there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snows here but in a context in which there has been discussion of local weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snows the personal pronouns and substitute one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context 
but if george has just been mentioned prominently and the trip to be made has been under discussion what is said is probably ill go with him and dominant stress is probably on the preposition with the personal pronoun has dominant stress because he has not been mentioned previously 
but when what is new in a particular context is also fairly obvious there is normally only light stress or no stress at all thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance from its use with snows nothing can snow snow but it 
if women replaced people it would normally have dominant stress in i have things to do the word things makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress than do 
in i know one thing dominant stress is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing in i knew you when you were a child and you were pretty then dominant stress on then implies that the young woman spoken to is still pretty 
in the written language then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here but much of the time the written language simply depends on the readers alertness and a careless reader will have to back up and reread often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion 
in she has it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily be on in where the notion of storedup antipathy seems to center in were painting at our garage strong stress on at indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an effort at painting 
thus in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for his and sisters but in his friends are stranger than his sisters strong stresses are normal for friends and sisters in hes hurting himself more than hes hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast 
sometimes strong stress serves to focus an important secondary relationship thus in mary wrote an account of the trip first strong stress on mary marks mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip strong stress on wrote marks the writing as the first of a series of actions of marys concerned with an account of her trip about which she may later have made speeches for example and strong stress on trip makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about which mary wrote accounts 
strong stress on hunger treats hunger as an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulates treats stimulation as an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treats man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger here again in the written language it is possible to help the reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics but much of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light of context 
thus when yes i have is the response to have you finished reading the paper the stress on have which here represents have finished reading the paper is quite strong 
macks the leader at camp but jacks here with this is deprived of stress makes here the complement in the clause in of all the suggestions that were made his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion and is stressed 
when it represents only itself and on which is its complement so that go on is semantically equivalent to board on has stronger stress than go does omission of a subordinator pronoun however does not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object 
but when to represents to consciousness in that was the moment that i came to and similarly in that was the moment i came to there is much stronger stress on to in i wanted to tell him but i was afraid to the final to is lightly stressed because it represents to tell him 
when i have instructions to leave is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions that i am to leave this place dominant stress is ordinarily on leave when the same sequence is equivalent in meaning to i have instructions which i am to leave dominant stress is ordinarily on instructions 
i cant be happy long without drinking water in the first of these sentences if by is the complement of come and tuesday is an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong stress on by in the spoken language 
in the second sentence if drinking water is a gerundial clause and without drinking water is roughly equivalent in meaning to unless i drink water there will be stronger stress on water than on drinking but if drinking is a gerundial noun modifying water and without drinking water is equivalent to without water for drinking there will be stronger stress on drinking than on water 
and patterns of stress are not always unambiguous by any means in the steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them and in i looked up the number and i looked up the chimney only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second 
syllables are genuine units but division of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties sometimes even the number of syllables is not clear 
from the point of view of word formation real might be expected to have two syllables historically re is the formative that is employed also in republic and al is the common suffix 
but there is every reason to regard deal as a monosyllable and because of the fact that /l/ commonly has the quality of aab/ when it follows vowel sounds deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with deal it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels 
improvement however is urgent and at least three things will be needed the first is a wideranging sample of successful tonal analyses 
an advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems including some of the more unusual types by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the oversimple distinction between register and contour languages 
tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of systems is familar to every practicing field linguist papers like these four if widely read will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work 
the result has been neglect fumbling efforts or superficial treatment as these maladies overlap so must the cure 
they will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures good field techniques will not only equip linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative attitudes 
but it is worth pondering that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics these things have been disseminated by other means but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results 
this can only be for one of two reasons either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory and hence techniques or our existing theories are insufficiently general if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems 
since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis actual practice does not often work out this way 
tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable 
of course something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of the phonology consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and an individual component but in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude 
pitch differences from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small differences between tones however any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded 
neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way 
some phonetic features for example glottal catch or murmur are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual systems but no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in some languages 
in some the ewe type mentioned above interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation spans in many of the syllables intonation can be safely ignored and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation 
a third explanation is suggested by richardsons analysis of sukuma tone there we see a basically simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system 
in the typical tone language tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal morphophonemics the phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic systems however are very different 
consonantal systems are not merely larger they are multidimensional morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system 
phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system tonal morphophonemics in a common case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone 
often therefore there are a number of rules having the same effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite effect tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number of rules is no greater 
this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of tonal analysis as well as the fact that vowel systems are often more puzzling than consonantal systems the statement of the system is a different matter 
a phonemic system can be stated without reference to morphophonemics but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics and the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics at least the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures 
there has been a tendency on the part of many american linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology when designing orthographies 
the result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography conferences by such considerations as typographic esthetics which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices carried over from european languages many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures that they purport to represent 
as a result many people have been confirmed in their conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion a e sharp in vowellength and syllabicity in kikuyu examines one set of related orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail 
to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail in the process he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult 
his orthographic recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other rather he weighs each phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness 
i hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circles this however will not exhaust their practical usefulness as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design 
one other paper deals with a phonologic problem vowel harmony in igbo by j carnochan this restates the already widely known facts in terms of prosodies 
but it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of igbo phonology the paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional though not structural statement 
but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods it seems to me that it rather easily can 
on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter my comments must be briefer than the papers deserve 
this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a short description of itemcategories in iraqw it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms 
there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from protoathabascan than the yokuts languages from protoyokuts this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier 
the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by the fact that athabascan shows ### stems per meaning slot as against ### for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample ## as against ##  on deduction of oneeighth from ### the stem / item rate becomes ### against ### in equivalent number of languages 
the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used these differences in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that hoijers vocabulary is based on swadeshs second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined 
i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley the result is that i included ## animal names but swadesh only # 
swadesh and therefore hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ox vulture salmon yellow pine manzanita their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts fish bird tree grass horn tail bark root 
other classes are included only by myself interrogatives adverbs or only by swadesh and hoijer pronouns demonstratives what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes # body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly even representation ## terms out of ### ## out of ### come out with nearly even ratios 
 # adjectives ## ## terms ratios ## versus ##  # verbs # ## terms ratios ## versus ## 
this exception may be connected with hoijers use of a much higher percentage of verbs ##% of his total list as against ##% in mine or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb

proposed property sales of general interest to small business concerns are publicized through sba regional news releases and by flyers directed to the small business concerns each sba regional office also maintains a want list of surplus property principally machinery and equipment desired by small business concerns in its area 
section #b# of the small business act as amended authorizes the sba to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business concerns the administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered 
purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in sbas facilities register so that the small business concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the congress in establishing the small business administration these services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on government contracts for products and services within the registrants field of operations

in most of the less developed countries however such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent only a very few of the more advanced ones such as india and pakistan have developed systematic techniques of programing 
only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country 
nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing first we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs 
third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the countrys objectives and resources this includes assistance in assembling the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends 
designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established 
it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth 
thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs in such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the countrys development was conditional upon programing progress being made 
a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of selfhelp it is vitally important that the new us aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves 
external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to selfhelp us aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take 
open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them 
the major areas of selfhelp are the following a the effective mobilizing of resources this includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment 
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few  b the reduction of dependence on external sources 
it also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed  c tapping the energies of the entire population 
otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability in many societies what we regard as corruption favoritism and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly 
moreover tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates antiamerican sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest some of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification correct or not of communist regimes with personal honesty and prowestern regimes with corruption 
the united states can use its aid as an incentive to selfhelp by responding with aid on a sustained basis tailored to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in selfhelp in many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts 
but there will be still other countries where despite the inadequacy of the level of selfhelp we shall deem it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance even in these cases we should promote selfhelp by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination 
to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion most of our aid will go to those nearing selfsufficiency
in several significant cases such as india a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no governmenttogovernment assistance these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance 
the number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into selfsustaining growth 
the whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world it must be recognized as a slowacting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba 
 a the need to budget a period of years many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods 
moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year 
 b the need to plan investment programs more importantly several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least # years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence 
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed  c the need to allocate country resources 
they must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policies they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary selfhelp measures which are described in the preceding section 
moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt they must therefore be related to longrange development plans 
in this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic longterm basis will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them 
perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with longterm commitments you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost ## years of service in the congress he has seen the kaisers and the hitlers and the mussolinis the tojos and stalins and khrushchevs come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest nation that mankind has ever known 
so i say mr speaker god bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the united states of america and the free world you remember the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in canada and dean rusk was in europe and vice president johnson was in asia who is running the store 
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record and also that they may have # legislative days in which to extend their remarks 
remarks of hon joseph p addabbo of new yorkit is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn 
i did so because i agree with so many here today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united states for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our government it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country 
many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me and like many of you here present i hold as the highlight of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable speaker of the house 
he was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel in conclusion he wished me well and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children 
he is most effective in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative accomplishments of this session he easily rose to great occasion even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle and as the nation witnessed these contests he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan i am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant 
one who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is endowed with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long may the divine speaker in heaven bless this country with sam rayburns continued service here for years to come 
in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilizing force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history 
here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual as a legislator as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation 
what sam rayburns life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of ones own community ones own district ones own state and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time for sam rayburn never forgot bonham his home community and he never forgot texas 
and if we follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country for what sam rayburns life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district 
this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson sam rayburns career up to this hour teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government more than that sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an ironclad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition 
sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions it is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics 
it is i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep but this we know here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor decency and selfrespect 
all but two of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under the speakership of sam rayburn i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness 
he will be considered not only great among his contemporaries but as great among all the americans who have played a part in the countrys history since the beginning i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and great american not only because today he establishes a record of having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress 
he had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the house in #### the ##d congress no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has sam rayburn 
but to run the gauntlet of the programs sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of todays record no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great legislator this great texan this great american 
sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of representatives in the congress of the united states others may speak of speaker rayburns uniquely long and devoted service 
i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution although sam rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition 
above all he is a person to whom a fledgling representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new congressman in this role of father confessor he has always been most characteristic and most helpful 
the practice of stateowned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years at least one state vehicle was in existence in #### 
the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in #### and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of stateowned transportation since that time the motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and effecting economies in vehicle operation 
purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes 
the meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the states administrative officers meaningful policies include a kinds of cars the state should own b when cars should be traded c the need and assignment of vehicles d use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances e employees taking cars home and f need for liability insurance on state automobiles 
the state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle the purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis 
the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles 
the state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars a survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode islands practices 
two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval states which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool 
nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances of these states the average changeover point at which a car is substituted for allowances is ##### miles per year 
actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personallyowned vehicles on state business at the rate of $## per mile fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a nonitemized basis 
rhode islands reimburseable rate of $## per mile for use of personallyowned cars compares favorably with other states rates the average of states rates is $### per mile 
actual mileage allowances are welladministered and not unduly expensive for the state the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive 
however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures flat payments over $## per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of stateowned vehicles 
with few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $## per day subsistence travel allowances are wellregulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control 
few records are available concerning the subject prior to #### the registry of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as #### 
the best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the ####s and ##s at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties 
once the principle was established the increase in stateowned vehicles came rapidly and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth 
this rate of increase does not signify anything in itself it does not indicate loose management ineffective controls or poor policy 
in the past twenty years the ratio of stateowned automobiles per state employees has varied from # to ## then to # to ## now whether there were too few automobiles in #### or too many now is problematical 
while the origin of stateowned automobiles may be obscured subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly prior to #### automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned 
in #### however the nation was at war the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual 
the motor pool then as now had headquarter facilities in providence and other garages located throughout the state it was organizationally the responsibility of the department of public works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pools operation 
the management of stateowned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made 
whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the costbilling system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period ######## while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased ##% the total maintenance cost increased only ##% 
the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles  note so far as state police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division 
moreover it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet for example if one driver puts on ##### miles per year and another driver #### miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have ##### miles after two years rather than ##### miles and related higher maintenance costs and ##### miles respectively 
it handles all types of vehicle maintenance but concentrates more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle repairs it contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work 
pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be traded for sound economies from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data 
based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of ##### miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personallyowned vehicles they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when costdata of compact cars is compiled the breakeven point may be reduced to #### miles of travel per year 
one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities present pool quarters at two locations in providence are crowded antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment 
the purchase of stateowned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made 
unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public the reasons are obvious # the state is buying in quantity and # it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay 
in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately costaccounting principles 
probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles the legislatures role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles 
there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax 
at the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments 
consequently there have developed several forms of grantsinaid and shared taxes as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level notwithstanding state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax 
taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons # local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs # the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult and # the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property among the many problems in the taxing of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant # situs # fair and equitable assessment of value 
although the laws of the various states in general specify the situs of property ie residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats airplanes mobile homes etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment rhode island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated 
in defining personal property it specifically mentions all ships or vessels at home or abroad intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year 
this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on december ## both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles 
obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the ##st day of december in view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft 
this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably justifiably middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ## months next preceding the first day of april in each year 
this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors who in general are nonprofessional and parttime personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode island 
the rhode island public expenditure council in its publication once commented the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property 
a single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of ## different and independent assessing units the institute of public administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission in #### recommended consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job 
to determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island the replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case 
these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not 
one assessor checked boats only another trailers and tractors one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type in two cases airplanes only were indicated 
boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property 
only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership 
twentyseven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property and only five were opposed on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now 
another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides 
there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date to summarize it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge 
interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting 
through their professional organization the rhode island tax officials association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors 
it is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation it is known that at least five towns barrington bristol narragansett newport and westerly place some value on some boats for tax purposes 
no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be slightly more than #### boats were registered with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law 
the assessors association meeting at narragansett in september #### devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem local industrys investment in rhode island was the big story in ####s industrial development effort 
with minor exceptions this expansion was instituted either by firms based in rhode island or outofstate manufacturers already operating here what made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although #### was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation rhode island scored marked progress in new industry new plants and new jobs 
leading firms that arranged their own financing included speidel corporation cornelldubilier photek inc division of textron narragansett gray iron foundry w r cobb company and mays manufacturing company expansion and relocation of industry in rhode island is the direct responsibility of the development councils industrial division and the figures quoted above indicate a successful years operation 
they are conscious of this states new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in rhode island although much of the industrial divisions promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries small business is also afforded considerable attention 
a primary function is the operation of a government bid center which receives bids daily from the federal governments principal purchasing agencies assistance is rendered to interested rhode island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations where to obtain specifications and followups concerning qualification 
in addition the offices domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses how and where to apply for financial assistance 
the office of foreign and domestic commerce is also active in the field of international trade assisting rhode island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad this office cooperates with the u s department of commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include statistics on markets abroad 
information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations licensing investments and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment during the year #### this office supplied ### visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce and made ## field visits 
we also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of rhode island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here to reach a still greater audience of locationminded manufacturers our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $##### to $##### and the industrial building authoritys financial participation was upped from $##### to $##### 
in addition to the regular schedule advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the new york times boston herald american banker electronic news and for local promotion the providence sunday journal magazine advertising included management methods the new englander u s investor and plant location 
the #### advertising campaign brought a total of ### inquiries ### from media and ## from direct mail 
new york led in the number of inquiries followed by california new jersey massachusetts and pennsylvania among foreign countries responding were germany canada brazil and india 
these consist of visits without previous announcement on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas more than ## carefully selected cities were visited including new york brooklyn long island city newark elizabeth stamford waterbury new haven bridgeport boston cambridge worcester and waltham 
we received ## outofstate visitors interested in investigating rhode islands industrial advantages and industrial division personnel made ## outofstate followup visits during #### two important conferences were organized by the development councils industrial division 
its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the united states declining balance of trade for #### and #### approximately ### representatives of business attended this conclave and the r i export conference committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event 
a comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted ### interested individuals morning sessions included addresses by ward miller jr of the u s dept of commerce 
workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from pennsylvania connecticut and maine and rounded out a rewarding program in connection with this conference a ##page supplement was published in the october #nd edition of the providence sunday journal 
more than #### copies have been sent out to prospective clients other special mailings by the industrial division included copies of speeches delivered at the governors conference letters and brochures to conferees at medchemical symposium at university of rhode island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as society of industrial realtors 
the industrial division published in #### a new attractive industrial brochure rhode island right for industry and prepared copy for a new edition of the directory of manufacturers to be printed shortly and for a new space catalogue additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for operation turnkey the new automated post office and a conference with representatives of brown university providence college and university of rhode island and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel 
the activities of the planning division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the development council which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning two years ago the institute of public administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled statelocal relations in metropolitan rhode island 
these objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the planning division first priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state 
it will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government to this end the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available on a shared cost basis technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff 
among the operating departments of the state between the cities and towns of the state 
on the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources plans for the provision of essential services such as water will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries within the framework of the state plan the state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan 
functionally the planning division carries out four activities longrange state planning current state planning local planning assistance and the preparation of the state development budget 
the longrange aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases basic mapping inventory analysis and plan and policy formation the work program as it was originally proposed was to take five years to complete 
the basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion july # #### since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program the first step taken by the planning division to implement the longrange state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps one at a scale of # inch to a mile and the second a series of ## sheets at a scale of # inch to #### feet covering the entire state 
with the aid of matching federal funds available under section ### of the housing act of #### as amended the planning division began a one year program july # #### to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program this phase consists of four items urban land use rural land use physical features and public utility service areas 
the urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning the rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the university of rhode island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use 
the collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island 
there are fortyseven special district governments in rhode island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the kent county water authority these fortyseven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes to borrow money own property sue and be sued and in general to exercise normal corporate powers 
it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government in addition to the collection of service charges the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $###### 
fortysix states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june ## the other four states end on varying dates alabama sept ## new york march ## pennsylvania may ## and texas august ## 
in eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on december ## while the state fiscal year ends on june ## arkansas colorado indiana kansas new hampshire new jersey ohio south dakota utah washington and wisconsin in eight states whose fiscal years close on june ## a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december ## 
one state alabama closes its fiscal year on september ## and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on september ## mississippi closes its fiscal year on june ## while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september ## 
all of its cities close their fiscal years on december ## the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments 
an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity # 
the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts 
by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures the uniform fiscal year brings the towns fiscal year into line with that of the schools which expend the largest share of local disbursements 
the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes furthermore tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in shortterm treasury notes augmenting the towns miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy 
when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons and as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases 
of all advantages probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times 
in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when shortterm money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most 
any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year 
both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap 
the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient statelocal revenue and expenditure relationships although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered 
one problem is a matter of shifting dates the other is how to finance the transition 
this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars it usually means a confused and disgruntled taxpaying public for a period of time 
the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city 
sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the municipalitys advantage to finance the changeover for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them 
first the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula second the shift to a uniform july # to june ## fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns 
the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section 
plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them 
however it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island based on a july # to june ## year are shown below 
these municipalities include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only 
six cities and towns are now on a july # to june ## fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity these cities and towns include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central falls and woonsocket 
both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars however neither of these two cities is on the desired july # to june ## fiscal year 
in that both cities end their fiscal years on september ## they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months commencing with september ## and ending with june ## these three installment dates would be october ## january ## and april ## providence and november ## february ## and may ## cranston 
their tax collection calendar could then be july ## october ## january ## and april ## providence and august ## november ## february ## and may ## cranston 
the remaining twentythree towns have fiscal years which end prior to june ## all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years 
aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements 
it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes 
as shown earlier in table # the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars in addition no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their overall financial condition 
each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the treasuries and the length of the transition interval suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from shortterm serial notes to longterm bonds 
for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem rhode island heritage week proclamation by john a notte jr governor

the institute is engaged in an extensive program of medicomilitary scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology among the specific areas of concentration in which the staff is engaged are such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the effects of microwaves 
investigation of respiratory diseases of laboratory animals there has been an increase in cooperative research with other federal agencies and civilian institutions 
also the defense atomic support agency sponsored a longrange study at this institute on the response of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation other scientific agencies both federal and civilian supported studies in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry and microcytochemistry 
morphological study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in animals and the study of structural changes in m leprae and other mycobacteria 
in addition to maintaining a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases wounds and injuries of military importance it provides facilities for clinical photography photomicrography and medical arts and operates a printing plant by permission of congressional committee for publication of an atlas of tumor pathology it also maintains shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets 
of these exhibits ### were newly constructed visual and operable training aids developed by the medical illustration service were used in support of army medical service mass casualty exercises 
demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conducted at the medical service instructors conference brooke army medical center texas in support of the emphasis placed by the department of defense on instruction in emergency medical care the medical illustration service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field tested 
the emergency medical treatment unit phase # and emergency war surgery in support of the north atlantic treaty organization nato handbook 
the british and canadian liaison officers as well as office of civil and defense mobilization the american red cross and similar interested organizations were informed from time to time as training aids were developed nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed and lantern slide teaching sets on ## pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the medical illustration service 
sixteen lantern slide sets were loaned to the government of india and eight sets were forwarded to the us embassy managua nicaragua for the educational exchange program the senate subcommittee on reorganization and international organizations was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the medical illustration service 
this consists of ## individual registries two of which were added during fiscal years ######## the registry of forensic pathology and the testicular tumor registry these registries are sponsored by ## national medical dental and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of followup of living patients the natural history of various diseases of militarymedical importance 
the staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings exhibits and published studies during the period of this report ##### new cases were entered into the various registries 
in this same period six new fascicles of the atlas of tumor pathology were published and distributed to medical centers worldwide there were ##### copies of fascicles sold and ### copies distributed free during this period 
nine new teaching clinicopathologic conference sets were prepared which makes a total of ## types of teaching sets for loan during this period #### teaching sets were distributed on loan 
the demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes in fiscal year #### the medical museum was moved to chase hall a temporary building on independence avenue at ninth street southwest and continued to display to the public the achievements of the armed forces medical services

during fiscal years #### and #### there were ###### visitors to the museum during the period from # july #### through ## january #### the medical museum was required to move to temporary building s on the mall from chase hall 
the armed forces medical publication agency established in #### has published since january #### the united states armed forces medical journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to medical department officers of the three military services its supplement the medical technicians bulletin supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel 
in addition their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated air force medical bulletin estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the journal and bulletin on a triservice basis as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service were between $##### and $##### 
from # july #### to ## june #### ## numbers of the journal and nine of the bulletin were published each journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest and departments devoted to military medical news reviews of new books and other features of interest to officers of the medical services 
beginning with the october #### issue of the journal the method of production of copy for photooffset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting this resulted in an improved appearance but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds 
two special issues were published one for november #### on space medicine the other the tenth anniversary issue for january #### the february #### issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled the medical officer writes 
occasional features were published on historical medicine special reports bibliography and collectors items in may #### the armed forces institute of pathology began a series of articles on the medical museum and in june the institute started contributing a regular monthly case for diagnosis 
the armed forces epidemiological board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its ## commissions so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the armed forces the first report in this continuing series appeared in the september #### issue of the journal 
this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to ## percent above that accepted a few years ago similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride 
in one of these an explodingwire device to study systems thermodynamically up to #### af and ### atmospheres pressure a major goal was achieved the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than # percent 
the method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy 
a highspeed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion the shutter consists of two parts a fastopening part and a fastclosing part 
the fastopening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera the opening action is obtained when a capacitor charged to high voltage is suddenly discharged through the foil 
experiments have shown that the shutter is ## percent open in about #### microseconds the shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil 
the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and perhaps planetary atmospheres among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides oh and ch 
very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable in interstellar gas concentrations as low as af molecules per af may be sufficient as compared to the af hydrogen atoms af required for detection of the ##cm line 
therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible to secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started 
this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the lowfrequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity the first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical 
the frequencies are ###### and ###### af with an uncertainty of ### af success in observing these spectral lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory 
the bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range ## to ## af the efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors and helium# vaporpressure measurements see p ### 
such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer when values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium# vapor pressures differences of about ## and # millidegrees respectively were found 
carbon resistors and impuritydoped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from ### to ## af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within #/# millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium 
the estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were # millidegree and for the third resistor ## millidegrees 
surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in ## and ##liter metallic storage dewars the gradient was about one half of a millidegree at ## af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point 
however the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vaporpressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface it has also been observed in helium # that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer 
in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow precise pressurevolumetemperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer 
the transducer is a nulltype instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm #### in thick and # in in diameter a small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced #### in apart for af 
over a temperature range from ## to ### af and at pressures up to ### atm an overload of ### psi applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter of mercury a #year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed 
a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present 
in march #### representatives of the national laboratories of australia canada the netherlands united kingdom ussr united states and west germany met at the nbs to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between ## and ## af as a first step toward this goal arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory 
these thermometers have now been sent to the united kingdom for calibration at the national physical laboratory during the last week of march #### columbus ohio was the site of the fourth symposium on temperature its measurement and control in science and industry 
the bureau contributed to the planning and success of the symposium through the efforts of mr w a wildhack general chairman and dr c m herzfeld program chairman dr a v astin nbs director opened the #day session with introductory remarks following which a total of twentysix papers were given throughout the week by nbs scientists from both the washington and boulder laboratories 
the programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation two data centers have been established for the collection indexing critical evaluation and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections 
an exhaustive survey was made of the literature and a primary reference file of approximately ### references was catalogued selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation 
this apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements a study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about af percent 
studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities these data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas 
new computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success in addition to the penalties provided in title ## united states code section #### any person guilty of any act as provided therein with respect to any matter under this title shall forfeit all rights under this title and if payment shall have been made or granted the commission shall take such action as may be necessary to recover the same

there is hereby authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated such sums as may be necessary to enable the commission to carry out its functions under this title mr speaker for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have 
and the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied ranging all the way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service there have been a number of sound plans proposed 
though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since world war # total annual rail commutation dropped ### million for #### to #### nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the new york city area 
at this time of crisis in our nations commuter railroads a new threat to the continued operations of the new york central has appeared in the form of the chesapeake & ohio railroads proposal for control of the baltimore & ohio railroads the new york central has pointed out that this control if approved by the interstate commerce commission would give the combined c & o b & o railroad a total of ### points served in common with the new york central 
the freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the c & o b & o provides the backbone of centrals revenues these revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire new york central system as well as the new york area commuter and terminal freight services 
the new york central today handles ## percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into new york city this is a $## million operation involving #### employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively 
there is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c & o b & o merger scheme the logic of creating a strong balanced competitive twosystem railroad service in the east is so obvious that b & o was publicly committed to the approach outlined here 
though far from completion these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned their investors their customers their users and to the public at large then abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned b & o entered onagainoffagain negotiations with c & o which resulted in the present situation 
the interstate commerce commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed c & o b & o merger on june ## obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force the new york central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge 
that is will it serve the longrange public interest for the past ## years congress has advocated a carefully planned balanced and competitive railway system 
which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders but the interests of all the traveling public mr speaker i rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper the new york times on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command 
i am pleased to note that mr sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the new york times mr sulzbergers successor as publisher is mr orvil e dryfoos who is president of the new york times co and who has been with the times since #### 
i am also pleased to note that mr john b oakes a member of the times staff since #### has been appointed as editorial page editor mr oakes succeeds charles merz editor since #### who now becomes editor emeritus 
my heartiest congratulations go to their successors orvil e dryfoos and john b oakes who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the new york times the people of the ##th district of new york and i as their representative in congress take great pride in the new york times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world 
yesterday i had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the us news & world report of may # which discussed this type of action in more detail including both its advantages and its disadvantages under leave to extend my remarks i include the relevant portion of my newsletter together with the text of the article from the us news & world report your congressman samuel s stratton reports from washington may # ####
in fact one of the major reasons for the failure of the illstarred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba has been getting this russian military equipment somehow the pictures and stories of soviet t## tanks on cuban beaches and russian mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark blunt truth of what it means to have a russian military base ## miles away from home 
once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba was clear president kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this even if we had to go it alone but the latin american republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing cuba off the interamerican defense board 
but it took the pictures of the migs and the t## tanks to do the job there is a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week 
efforts as i see it which are being directed by the way toward support for future actions not for those already past what the next move will be only time of course will tell 
we simply cant tolerate further russian weapons including the possibility of longrange nuclear missiles being located in cuba obviously we cant stop them from coming in however just by talk 
 from us news & world report may # #### next for cuba an arms blockade 
in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too this is the question now facing president kennedy how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere 
its aim to undermine further cubas economy another strategy bolder and tougher was also attracting notice in washington a naval and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro 
it could halt a flood of communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching castro it could stop cuban reexport of guns and propaganda materials to south america 
it is the strategy of blockade therefore that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials members of congress officers in the pentagon as a possible course of action it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions 
military experts say a tight naval blockade off cuban ports and at the approaches to cuban waters would require two naval task forces each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about ### planes and several destroyers the navy on april ## announced it is bringing back the carrier shangrila from the mediterranean increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of cuba 
to round out the blockading force submarines would be needed to locate identify and track approaching vessels a squadron of navy jets and another of longrange patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces 
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it once these conditions of international law are met countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk 
they could be sent to us ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by opposing communist interference in the western hemisphere 
primary target would be shipments of tanks guns aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from russia and czechoslovakia shipments of arms from western countries could similarly be seized as contraband 
at times three ships a day from the soviet bloc are unloading in cuban ports from its inception in #### with the passage of public law ### ##th congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the states by means of grantsinaid to return disabled men and women to productive gainful employment 
up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training counseling and placement on a job recognizing the limitations of such a program the ##th congress in #### passed p l ### which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities and which revised the financing structure 
to assist the states therefore in rehabilitating handicapped individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities the ##rd congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation amendments of #### p l ### these amendments to the vocational rehabilitation act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more sheltered and halfway workshops for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the homebound and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the programs overall effectiveness 
under p l ### ##th congress the federal government assumed responsibility for ###% of necessary state expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled and for ##% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services throughout these years the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the act 
and # research demonstrations training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for shortterm training and instruction the first part of the new structure that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services is described in this section 
the following table shows for selected years the authorizations appropriations allotment base federal grants to states and state matching funds for this part of the grant program in order to assist the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section # of the amended act provides that allotments to states for support of such services be based on # need as measured by a states population and # fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income 
it stipulates in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the ceiling and not used for insuring the floor be redistributed to those states still below their maximums these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the states with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated state 
the method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the act the term state means the several states the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico 
the following steps are employed in calculations # for each state except puerto rico guam the virgin islands and prior to #### alaska and hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years 
determine the average per capita income for the u s based on the last three years  see source of data below for per capita income data to be used in this step 
determine for each state except the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii that percentage which bears the same ratio to ##% as the particular states average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u s  multiply the result obtained in item # above by the result obtained for each state in item # above 
by law this is ##% for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico  alaska and hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year #### 
except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less than ###/#% nor more than ##% if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these extremes the states allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme 
multiply the population of each state by the square of its allotment percentage  multiply result obtained in item # above by result obtained in item # above 
 for each state make all computations set forth in items # to # above and then add the results obtained for each state in item # determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the states 
determine the particular states unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year  multiply the state product in item # above by the result obtained in item ## above 
 each states unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item ## below by a percentage greater than one and onehalf times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $######## must be reduced by the amount of the excess determine if the particular states unadjusted allotment result obtained in item ## above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment 
the funds recouped by reductions in item ## above are used first to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those states where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item ## above and second to increase uniformly the allotments to those states whose allotments are below their maximums with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceeding its maximum 
funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine as is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula 
prior to and since #### the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot of ##% state or ##% federal participation in total program costs the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any state is referred to in the law as that states federal share 
beginning in #### the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required ##% a year so that by #### the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a ##% pivot state share with maximum and minimum state shares of ##% and ##% respectively the pre#### rate of federal participation with respect to any states base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the #### #### period is designated by the statute as that states adjusted federal share 
the purpose of the adjusted federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates the method used for computing the respective federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the act 
the term united states includes the several states and the district of columbia and excludes the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to #### alaska and hawaii the following steps are employed in the calculations # 
 the same amount used in item # under method of computing allotments above determine the average per capita income for the united states for the last three years 
determine the ratio of ##% to the average per capita income of the united states  divide ## by the amount used in item # above 
 multiply the result obtained in item # above by the amount used for each state in item # above determine the particular states federal share 
 alaska and hawaii had fixed federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year #### in all other states it is the difference obtained by subtracting from ### the result obtained in item # above 
if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these extremes the states federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested on the inside # inches of the block wall 
the wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall mortar is poured between this bracing and the #inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding 
the first one or two roof boards marked e in fig # are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside the shelter these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter 
the roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together work on the roof continues in this way 
when the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and dense are used for this shelter 
solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection if they are used the walls and roof should be ## inches thick to give the same protection as the #inch solid concrete blocks 
more detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen other sources of information include the national concrete masonry association ## south dearborn street chicago ill the portland cement association ## west grand avenue chicago ill and the structural clay products association washington dc 
 most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter this shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it impractical to build an underground shelter 
the space between them is filled with pitrun gravel or earth the walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built 
an alternate roof perhaps more within doityourself reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams overlaid with boards and waterproofing it would have to be covered with at least ## inches of pitrun gravel 
the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection preshaped corrugated metal sections or precast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground 
they form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth as shown in figure ## materials for this shelter would cost about $### 
his charges would be added to the cost of materials this shelter as shown on page ## would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation 
the national lumber manufacturers association washington d c is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction the structural clay products institute washington dc is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction 
the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection the illustration fig ## shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over 
plans for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance are shown on pages ## and ## another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction 
the shelter illustrated in figure ## is based on such a room built in a new home in the washington dc area in the spring of #### important considerations common to each type of shelter are # 
therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance 
a blower is essential for the doublewall shelter and for the underground shelters it should provide not less than # cubic feet per minute of air per person 
radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made 
continuous lowlevel lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a #cell hotshot battery to which is wired a ###milliampere flashlighttype bulb tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least ## days 
a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas 
other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the appendix page ## 
bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed the basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection 
fortynine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about # percent of what it was an hour after the explosion but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous 
radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation there is a possibility that batterypowered radios with builtin radiation meters may become available 
it will tell you as soon as possible how long to stay in your shelter 
a checklist in the appendix page ## tells what is needed there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated 
to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio 
blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement 
the housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied food medical supplies utensils and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it 
sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem 
a ##gallon garbage can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully 
it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable 
warm clothing and bedding of course are essential some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need 
few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation 
the best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to onetenth of the outside level 
if there is time after the warning the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks dirt books magazines or other heavy material large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings 
the central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling 
the problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management 
lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du pont products were actively promoted within a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of general motors eight operating divisions 
competitors came to receive higher percentage of general motors business in later years but it is likely that this trend stemmed at least in part from the needs of general motors outstripping du ponts capacity the fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du ponts production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont by a stock interest 
this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price quality and service were not overlooked by either du pont or general motors however it determined that neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone including du ponts competitors outweighed the governments claim for relief 
the latter provisions proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempts combinations or conspiracies to monopolize such trade however this court put to one side without consideration the governments appeal from the dismissal of its sherman act allegations 
no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce this section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial lessening of competition 
section # is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation the section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies or the substantial lessening of competition have occurred or are intended 
indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between du pont and general motors acted honorably and fairly and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies this however did not bar finding that du pont had become preeminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to general motors 
that general motors share of the market for these products was substantial and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns 
we repeat that the test of a violation of # is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints the conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition 
the sole guidance given the court for discharging the task committed to it was this the judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the district court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute 
international salt co v united states ### u s ### ###### this brings us to the course of the proceedings in the district court 
the first pretrial conference held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings took place on september ## #### at the outset the governments spokesman explained that counsel for the government and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court 
the government deeming these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du ponts shares of general motors counsel for the government invited du ponts views on this proposal before recommending a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days 
no previous antitrust case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief the submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract 
the government submitted its proposed decree on october ## #### the plan called for divestiture by du pont of its ######## shares of general motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders as a dividend over a period of ten years 
if in the trustees judgment reasonable market conditions did not prevail during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the tenyear period in addition the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be vested in du ponts stockholders other than christiana and delaware and the stockholders of delaware 
du pont christiana and delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with general motors and vice versa and general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies 
on may # #### the commissioner announced his rulings the annual dividends paid to du pont stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du ponts earnings and profits 
in the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du ponts tax basis for them which is approximately $### per share the forced sale of the general motors stock owned by or allocable to christiana delaware and the stockholders of delaware and deposited with the trustee would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate 
under its plan du pont would retain its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares christiana and delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders 
du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general motors distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders on june # #### general motors submitted its objections to the governments proposal 
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies that the tremendous volume of general motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital 
general motors comprehensively contended that the government plan would not be in the public interest as required by the mandate of this court the decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in august of #### 
both plans also prohibited common directors officers or employees between du pont christiana and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the other it is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude unnourished by sense to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship 
by making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in wyatt v united states ### us ### where the court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection one need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in american life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself 
the courts opinion dogmatically asserts that the husbandwife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine enthrones an unreality into a rule of law i am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed 
petitioner who claims to be a conscientious objector was convicted of violating ##a of the universal military training and service act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces he claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the fifth amendment because # at a hearing before a hearing officer of the department of justice he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board and # at the trial he was denied the right to have the hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim 
petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings because the statement in question was in his file to which he had access and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the department of justice and before the appeal board petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officers notes and report especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the department of justices recommendation to the appeal board 
haydn c covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner daniel m friedman argued the cause for the united states 
mr justice clark delivered the opinion of the court this is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services in violation of the provisions of the universal military training and service act ## stat ###### ## usc app aj ### a 
he says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board and further that he was denied at trial the right to have the department of justice hearing officers report and the original report of the federal bureau of investigation as to his claim all in violation of the fifth amendment the trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents 
we granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the act we have concluded that petitioners claims are controlled by the rationale of gonzales v united states ### us ### #### and united states v nugent ### us # #### and therefore affirm the judgment 
his answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of jehovahs witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer he claimed #d classification as a minister of religion devoting a minimum of ### hours a month to preaching 
on november ## #### he wrote the board protesting this classification he again stated that he was a regular minister 
on april # #### after some six months of fulltime pioneering petitioner discontinued devoting ### hours a month to preaching but failed to so notify his local board in a periodic review the local board on july ## #### reclassified him #a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home 
he was not prosecuted however and his case was subsequently reopened in the light of sicurella v united states ### us ### #### he was again reclassified #a by the local board 
in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service on march ## #### however the department recommended approval of the #a classification 
it reported that he now devoted only some ##/# hours per month to public preaching and from ## to ## hours per month to church activities his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his veracity and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith 
in his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement in #### and asserted that his only claim to pioneering was in #### the appeal board however unanimously concurred in the departments recommendation 
petitioner first contends that the department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting ### hours to actual preaching but the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file 
this he failed to do asserting that he did not know it to be in his file apparently he never took the trouble to find out 
after the recommendation of the department is forwarded to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial we found in gonzales v united states supra that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant 
we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioners contention which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it as was said in gonzales it is the appeal board which renders the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact 
but there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult at his trial petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the departments hearing officer evensen as well as his report thereon 
he alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might disclose 
but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing officers report to be likewise turned over to the registrant while the regulations formerly required that the hearing officers report be placed in the registrants file this requirement was eliminated in #### 
it is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board 
hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the department on file with the board petitioner knew that the departments recommendation was based not on the hearing officers report but on the statement of the local board in his file 
it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officers report and notes at the trial in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes 
moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts in the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the departments recommendation which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no relevancy in the hearing officers report and notes 
he did receive a resume of it the same that was furnished the appeal board and he made no claim of its inaccuracy he bases his present contention on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume 
there we held that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the fbi reports must be produced for their inspection even if we were not bound by nugent petitioner here would not be entitled to the report 
with this enlarged role in mind i should like to make a few suggestions what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context 
foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad that means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation 
it is also the concern of the department of state that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce we can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences between this and other departments 
means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action 
unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present the movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present 
action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control there will of course be times for delay and inaction 
i also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas an affliction of all bureaucracies we want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the department 
i hope no one expects that only presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas the responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function regardless of rank 
while observing the operations of our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort to cite only a few examples the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy 
dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them 
if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas this does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion 
he is expected to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action 
i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine 
his first thought is about the question itself is there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is it for he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer 
meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history he is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policyoriented conclusions 
he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog 
he will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted he must think about which of these principles must take precedence 
he is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole when the whole is too large to grasp 
who should be consulted among his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies of the government which american ambassadors could provide helpful advice 
what is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved how and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted 
the selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself can the president or the secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required 
is the matter one for the united nations or some other international body for if so the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem 
for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it he is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the american public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind 
may i add a caution on this particular point we do not want policy officers below the level of presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action 
mr truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows in the department of state dont know much about domestic politics if we sit here reading editorials and looking at publicopinion polls and other reports that cross our desks we should realize that this is raw undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership 
we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action i doubt for example that # months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the marshall plan any publicopinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals 
and the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women 
there should be no draft exemption because of peace corps service in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment 
nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid the guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services 
peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all conspicuous consumption 
some special health requirements might have to be met for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers 
for readjustment to the us volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served in what part of the government should the peace corps be established 
support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development 
pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state when the aid operations are reorganized the peace corps should remain a semiautonomous functional unit 
in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations how and when should the peace corps be launched 
the peace corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this years graduating classes will not be lost nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses 
within a year or two several thousand might be in service it can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated 
the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest there would however be a variety of other skills medical agricultural engineering which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects 
how will the peace corps be received abroad although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country 
unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends 
in presenting it to other governments and to the united nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands 
the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership our aim must be to learn as much as we teach 
if presented in this spirit the response and the results will be immeasurably better the already appropriated funds within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act are the only immediately available source of financing this summers pilot programs of the peace corps 
congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year specifically congress should consider authorizing the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large 
an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding steps should also be taken to link the food for peace program with the peace corps so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of us surplus food under pl ### can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps personnel 
is it worth the cost and the risks no matter how well conceived and efficiently run there probably will be failures 
but as the popular response suggests the potentiality of the peace corps is very great it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions 
it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before 
the letters home the talks later given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policies toward the world and this is meeting the worlds need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world 
as you said in your state of the union message the problems are towering and unprecedented and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps a pool of trained american men and women sent overseas by the us government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower 
the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization in addition by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall 
its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires 
one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations the vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge 
this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice 
in #### onequarter of the ### million recreation visits to the national forests and grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing hunter and fisherman visits since #### have increased # times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses 
the longrange objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment the wildlife habitat management proposals for the ##year period are # 
improve food and cover on ## million acres of key wildlife areas develop wildlife openings food patches and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on ###### acres 
the total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage values and disrupt uses 
if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the ## billion board feet in #### about ## percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease ## percent to insects ## percent to fire and ## percent to weather animals and various other causes 
the longrange objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and highlevel sustained yield of products and services this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations 
in the ##year period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period this will require about a ## percent increase over the present level of protection 
 b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage  c quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a largescale epidemic 
continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to ###### acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed 
coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses it is proposed that in ## years all commercial timberlands all critical watersheds and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads 
an additional ## million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for # 
this is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort detection skilled firefighting crews and equipment use this will include a steppedup program of training and development of personnel 
reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to highvalue areas this work will cover the most serious onefourth of all land needing such treatment and will consist of burning ###### acres of highly hazardous debris concentration felling snags on ###### acres of high lightningoccurrence areas prescribed burning on ## million acres removing roadside fuel on ##### acres and clearing and maintaining ##### miles of firebreaks 
these areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forests approximately ## million acres of rangelands and ## million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period 
the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the secretary of agriculture 
in the forest highway system there are now ##### miles of public roads these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another 
it is estimated that about ##### miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests in the forest development road and trail system there are now ###### miles of roads and ###### miles of supplemental foot and horse trails 
construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture it is estimated that about ###### miles of forest development roads and ##### miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis 
it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as a 
the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas the volume of timber that can be marketed especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises 
the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible 
use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve the longrange objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services 
service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about ###### miles of new roads and #### miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about ###### miles of roads and ##### miles of trails about ##### miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads 
program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the ##year period ######## are as follows # complete the construction and reconstruction of about ##### miles of multiplepurpose roads and #### miles of trails 
approximately ## percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of national forest timber but paid for by the government through adjustment of stumpage prices provide maintenance to full standards on the ###### miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period 
in some units national forest ownership is well blocked together in many others the previous patenting of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership 
one consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these federal lands 
there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the eastern states 
strategy and tactics of the us military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history the change of emphasis from conventionaltype to missiletype warfare must be made with care mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other 
 this budget will provide in the fiscal year #### for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level a yearend strength of ####### men and women in the active forces the forces to be supported include an army of ## divisions and ###### men 
a marine corps of # divisions and # air wings with ###### men and an air force of ## combat wings and ###### men 
quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve 
last year the congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve similar restrictions on the strength of the army national guard contained in the #### department of defense appropriation act should likewise be dropped 
i again proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from their present strengths of ###### and ###### respectively to ###### and ###### by the end of the fiscal year #### these strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives 
these expenditures are estimated to be $### billion an increase of $### million over #### reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependents an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in #### compared with only # months in #### retired pay costs are increased by $## million in #### over #### partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel 
traditionally rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel the #### military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a #% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june # #### 
 expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed forces are estimated to be $### billion in #### which is $### million more than in #### the increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment 
also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in #### causing an increase in expenditures further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year 
in total these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces in the budget message for #### and again for #### i recommended immediate repeal of section ### of the act of september ## #### ## stat ### 
as i have stated previously the attorney general has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles accordingly if it is not repealed by the congress at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise 
the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met as they have in other states through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these governmentowned systems in alaska and its early enactment is desirable 
in #### these expenditures are estimated at $### billion compared to $### billion in #### the decreases which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices 
new obligational authority for #### recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction totals $#### million which is $#### million below that enacted for #### on the other hand the new authority of $#### million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in #### is $### million higher than for #### 
the department of defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items as i have repeatedly stated this provision is much more restrictive than the general law popularly known as the buy american act 
the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without endangering other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress the last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history 
furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological breakthrough on any one weapon system in itself often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems this has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events 
for example the importance of the regulus # a very promising aerodynamic shiptosurface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines another example is the recent cancellation of the f### a longrange interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid####s 
considering the high cost of the f### system over $# billion for the force that had been planned and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message 
notable in this category are the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and deployed but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile the impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the highenergy fuel program 
continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the highenergy fuel program as a result the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed 
the cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it  the deterrent power of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war 
the second capability is represented by our deployed ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement the strategic air command is the principal element of our longrange nuclear capability 
this aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about #### would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier the first atlas icbms are now operational the first two polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first titan icbms next year 
by #### several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established thus the need for the b## as a strategic weapon system is doubtful 
it is expected that in #### two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system 
these additional modern bombers will replace some of the older b## medium bombers one b## can do the work of several b##s which it will replace 
in the coming fiscal year additional quantities of atlas titan and polaris missiles also will be procured purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities including the classes types and/or varieties of food grain the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale and other relevant matters 
under this agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in august #### at that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the united states supplies of rice available for title # disposal indias production consumption and stocks of food grains other imports from the united states and countries friendly to the united states indias storage capacity and other related factors any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year 
the united states government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after june ## #### that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency the two governments agree that the rupees accruing to the government of the united states of america as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this agreement will be used by the government of the united states of america in such manner and order of priority as the government of the united states of america shall determine for the following purposes in the amounts shown a

in the event that agreement is not reached on the use of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date of this agreement the government of the united states of america may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by section ### of the act in the event the total of rupees accruing to the government of the united states of america as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this agreement is different from the rupee equivalent of $#### million the amounts available for the purposes specified in paragraph # article # will be adjusted proportionately 
the two governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities pursuant to the agreement will not displace usual marketings of the united states of america in these commodities or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries in carrying out this agreement the two governments will seek to assure to the extent practicable conditions of commerce permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural commodities 
the two governments will upon the request of either of them consult regarding any matter relating to the application of this agreement or to the operation of arrangements carried out pursuant to this agreement the agreement shall enter into force upon signature

the present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast am band from ### kc to #### kc whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each interferes to some extent with reception of the other 
other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and others with the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a casetocase basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances 
an example of the overall standards applied is the ##to# ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable by this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved objectionable interference from station a exists at any point within the service area of station b where station as signal is of an intensity onetwentieth or more of the strength of station bs signal at that point 
a second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere 
but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general negligible but during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere thereby creating the possibility of one stations rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies 
it was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions and vice versa is not an instantaneous process but takes place over periods of time from roughly # hours before sunset until about # hours after sunset and again from roughly # hours before sunrise until some # hours after sunrise during the period of about # hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail 
however in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an averaging of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions it was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose 
class # stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class # stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class # station where located west of the class # station for limitedtime class # stations the same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class # stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other 
these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data it was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength 
as mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation 
to provide some service to all listeners to provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible 
since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others accordingly the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations 
in dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above provision of service to all listeners was predominant the class # stations on these clear channels are protected to their ##mv/m groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference 
class # b stations are protected at night to their ##mv/m ##percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class # stations are capable of rendering skywave service 
with respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class # and class # stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of longrange service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible 
during nighttime hours because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it therefore under our longstanding allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class # a station is permitted to operate at night so that the # a station can render service interference free wherever it can be received 
in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels additional class # assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class # stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities 
similarly on the regional channels many class # stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power essentially the question presented for decision in the present daytime skywave proceeding is whether our decision in ######## to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset is sound as a basis for am allocations or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours 
since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena in #### affidavits were filed with the commission by various clearchannel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class # stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference

the one or twoseason hunt of which there have been too many recently may do more harm than good for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued 
for the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time the central group of the foundations advisors are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board consisting now of thirtysix men and women 
their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the trustees minds for this concept of an advisory board ancillary to the board of trustees we are indebted to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration 
for in accordance with mr lowells concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices and lest we should become too consistent in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts the foundations board of trustees maintains a trickle not a flow 
two committees of members of the advisory board constitute the committees of selection one for the selection of fellows from canada the united states and the englishspeaking caribbean area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american republics and the republic of the philippines to the members of our advisory board and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection the foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of fellows 
and quality of advice added to devotion to the foundations purposes and ideals we do get from our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day but the facts about our advisory board and its members duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base our selections of fellows 
and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers of music novelists poets essayists choreographers lawyers servants of government and men of affairs hundreds indeed who serve the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience to all the foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are 
during the biennium reviewed in this report our board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the board and to top management to insure future continuance of the firstclass administration of the foundations affairs dr james brown fisk physicist president of the bell telephone laboratories was elected to the board of trustees 
and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions dr gordon n ray provost vicepresident and professor of english in the university of illinois was appointed associate secretary general 
dr ray is a fellow of the foundation appointed thrice to assist his studies of william makepeace thackeray and of h g wells and before his appointment to the foundations executive staff had been given our highest scholarly accolade appointment to the advisory board referring further to the foundations officers dr james f mathias for eleven years our discerning colleague as associate secretary was promoted to be secretary 
also appointed to the foundations staff as assistant secretary is mr j kellum smith jr mr smith like the present secretary general is a lawyer 
the present secretary general has been the foundations principal administrative officer continuously since the foundations establishment thirtyfive years ago but even he will not last indefinitely and the abovenoted new arrangements are quite simply made to assure qualitative continuity in the foundations policies and practices

forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit as the roman poet virgil declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today it gives indeed cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced 
for example out of the social evils of the english industrial revolution came the novels of charles dickens and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all western men until today in the industrialized west these social evils substantially do not exist 
these were educated men who as mr justice holmes was fond of saying formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility that is to put it realistically they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected 
but as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened the gulf between the rich and the poor has narrowed in the industrialized western world to the point that the word poor is hardly applicable 
some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit and even putting it that way would not prove that marx was anything but wrong 
the essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice 
the greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change for change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future 
the eternal truth is that progress due as it always is to individual creative genius is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart and lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report let me enlighten them with the truths that under communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed untrammeled in every way toward their discoveries their creative efforts for the good of mankind 
as heretofore our fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts we do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation is good provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life as all firstrate scholarship and artistic creation does 
thus we have no part and want none in current discussions of the relative importance of science the social studies the humanities the creative arts we want no part in such discussions because we think them largely futile 
when the brown & sharpe manufacturing company reached its ###th year as a going industrial concern during #### it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world with its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution brown & sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder joseph r brown and a worldrenowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology 
he was early exposed to the mechanical world and in his youth often helped his father david brown master clock and watchmaker as he plied his trade at the age of ## he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott & harris in valley falls rhode island and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation he went into business for himself in #### making lathes and small tools 
the years of josephs partnership with his father were numbered in #### a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter david brown moved west to illinois settling on a land grant in his declining years 
much of his genius of course sprang from his familiarity with clock movements during these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young mans occupation 
but his business also grew and we are told that mr brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire it must have been with some pleasure and relief that on september ## #### joseph brown made the momentous entry in his job book in his characteristically cryptic style lucian sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice 
the company became j r brown & sharpe and entered into a new and important period of its development mr sharpes arrival in the business did indeed provide what mr brown had most coveted time for tinkering and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time 
the basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in #### by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine that development in turn formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years in gear cutting in circular graduating in index drilling and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement 
several efforts were made in this direction and though not all of them survive to this day the brown & sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the american standard and is still in common use today as one development followed another the companys reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture 
as the story goes mr gibbs who originally came from the back counties of the commonwealth of virginia saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe sewing machine curious as to what made it work he built a crude model of it in wood and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread enabling the crude machine to take stitches 
thus was invented the single thread sewing machine which mr gibbs in partnership with mr willcox decided to bring to brown & sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture the new work was a boon to the partnership not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of j r brown toward yet further developments for production equipment 
mr brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock and reversible tap and die holders in #### mr browns attention was called to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drills 
this process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor mr browns imagination of the possibilities in the situation the child of this problem was mr browns famous serial no # universal milling machine the archtype from which is descended todays universal kneetype milling machine used throughout the world 
during the civil war period mr brown also invented the brown & sharpe formed tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the worlds gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth but they were good for only one sharpening 
this process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated resharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form mr browns invention achieved this and as a byproduct formed the cornerstone of brown & sharpes position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the ####s when superceded by other methods 
although mr brown was not himself its inventor it was a french idea it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use so it was that when mr brown and mr sharpe first saw the french tool on exhibition in paris in #### they brought a sample with them to the united states and started brown & sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day 
that achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine which made its appearance in #### at the philadelphia centennial exposition this machine like its milling counterpart was the antecedent of a machinefamily used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world 
following mr browns death there came forward in the brown & sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company as head of the firm darling & swartz mr darling began by challenging brown & sharpe to its keenest competition during the ####s and early ##s 
between that year and the buying out of mr darlings interest in #### a large portion of the companys precision tool business was carried out under the name of darling brown & sharpe and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of mr browns tradition for accuracy was mr oscar j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of mr brown and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled brown & sharpe to manufacture gages and therefore its products with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world 
mr viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men he was an ardent champion of the brown & sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company 
commencing with the death of lucian sharpe in #### the name of henry d sharpe was for more than ## years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company during his presidency the companys physical plant was enormously expanded and the length and breadth of the brown & sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world 
during these years the companys product line followed the basic tenets laid down by mr brown it expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines from simple formedtooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business from rudimentary beltdriven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled kneetype and manufacturing type milling machines 
in #### henry d sharpe jr succeeded his father and continued the companys development as a major factor in the metalworking equipment business the company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts 
recently added is the brown & sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development in the industrial products division the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinists tools including micrometers vernier calipers and accessories 
sales and net income for the year ended december ## #### showed an improvement over #### net income was $####### or $### per share on ###### common shares currently outstanding as compared to $####### or $### per share in #### adjusted to the same number of shares 
this increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development in spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year #### at a rate materially higher than during #### 
however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of #### in connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sounder u s income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on leesonas business in the next few years 
our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against lowcost production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at leesona this program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money 
but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the unifil loom winder and our more recent uniconer automatic coning machine on this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to leesonas future growth in sales and earnings 
in december we began to ship our ultrahighspeed stretch yarn machines these machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics 
fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved wash and wear dresses and blouses made from these fabrics this machine operating at speeds up to ###### revolutions per minute is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today 
our new largepackage ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers mills later in the year additional types of this leesona twister will be made available to mills for other manmade fibers and natural yarns 
this we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment major activity at providence in #### will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the uniconer automatic coning machine 
this machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder 
it incorporates an automatic knottying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in ## seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted because the bobbintocone winding process is a relatively highcost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provided by the uniconer can mean important economies in textile production at the same time upgrading quality 
a new application for the unifil loom winder running single filling for box looms will broaden mill use of this equipment a new spinning takeup machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our takeup machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns 
this new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to #### feet per minute it is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time 
we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field we are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction 
the cooperation of our exclusive american licensee pratt & whitney aircraft division of united aircraft corporation has been important in this work in addition to its major effort on fuel cells patterson moos research division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department other government agencies and for our own account 
we have recently entered into an agreement with compagnie generale de telegraphie sans fil csf of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the united states 
there is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military further research we believe will develop important commercial applications 
we are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity the rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation 
early in august we broke ground for a new $####### plant in warwick rhode island which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of this year 
operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in #### an architects sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover 
however its modern onestory layout is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force 
during the year our british subsidiary leesonaholt limited expanded its plant in darwen england and added machine tool capacity the operations of its other plant in rochdale and leesonas former operations in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of heywood 
the area available at heywood is approximately three times the size of the former rochdale and manchester locations in addition land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future 
it will be transfered on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a nonprofit organization which will reimburse us for the cost of construction we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase 
interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank in addition to expenditures on the warwick plant we have invested approximately $####### for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at leesonaholt limited 
long term loans have been reduced by $###### to $####### inventories increased $###### to $####### during the year and should decline in coming months 
in accordance with the twoyear contract signed in may #### with the international association of machinists aflcio wages of hourly employees were increased by #% in may #### and pay levels for nonexempt salaried employees were increased proportionately in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semiprivate hospital accommodations 
during the pension year ended december ## #### ## employees retired making a total of ### currently retired under the companys pension plan at december ## #### the fund held by the industrial national bank of providence as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan totaled $####### 
another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living as in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years 
as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility the problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration 
in addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics as well as blends following the term of service in japan each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community 
the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining under skilled direction the choir the orchestra the band the glee club and smaller ensembles of wind and string players 
orchestra band and choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes the glee club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership 
student musical organizations are the knights of carleton and the overtones mens vocal groups and the keynotes a womens singing group these studentdirected organizations include eight to ten members each 
courses are offered in ethics the philosophy and history of religion christian thought and history and the bible carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students 
the sermons are given by the college chaplain by members of the faculty or by guest preachers music is furnished by the carleton college choir 
the service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced a sunday evening program provides theological lectures music drama and films related to the issues of the judeochristian tradition 
each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings the ymca and ywca at carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes 
the associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships to broaden their interests and to engage in worthwhile service projects there are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups 
student religious organizations are coordinated under the religious activities committee a standing committee of the carleton student association the northfield churches include the following alliance congregationalbaptist episcopal lutheran norwegian danish missouri synod and bethel methodist moravian pentecostal and roman catholic 
to encourage the practice of attending the theater and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance 
for the ######## season the carleton players have announced blood wedding by federico garcia lorca the knight of the burning pestle by beaumont and fletcher and a moon for the misbegotten by eugene oneill with a preseason production of the glass menagerie by tennessee williams this workshop located in boliou hall provides facilities for students to work in ceramics weaving enameling welding woodworking textile printing printmaking and lapidary 
the workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week a student organization bottega is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical technical and productive contexts 
they are assisted and advised by members of the art department the athletic program at carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the college and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work 
the same standards for admission for eligibility to receive scholarships or grantsinaid and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students a faculty committee on athletics responsible to the faculty as a whole exercises control over the athletic program of the college 
carleton is a member of the midwest collegiate athletic conference and abides by its eligibility rules in addition to these rules carleton has added the following # 
the school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester a student to be eligible for the captaincy of any carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least ### 
the purpose of the club is to promote better athletic teams at carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body this is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the carleton cheerleaders

weekend activities for the entire campus are planned by the coop board in recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future 
the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle this caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level 
factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below #### the total value of our industrys shipments at factory prices increased from $## billion in #### to approximately $### billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement 
reflecting the largest percentage of highend sets such as consoles and combinations since #### dollar value of home entertainment electronics in #### was about $## billion compared to $## billion in #### sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of #### through july 
for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came to ## million against ## million in #### however production came to only ## million compared to ## million 
both home and auto radios were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of #### in every month of the first eleven sales and production of home sets were about equal at ### million units 
separate phonographs also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radiotv market the outlook for entertainment electronics in #### is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods 
i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at ## million sets for the year but i look for some decline in radios from the high rate in #### to more nearly the #### level of ### ### million sets i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $## million slightly below #### but above #### 
it is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industrys total sales to all markets in ######## which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance it has been correctly pointed out by wellinformed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of ##% or better that characterized the decade of the ####s and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability 
among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the polaris and b## programs strengthening of the airborne alert system of the strategic air command and improved battlefield surveillance systems research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite samos and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as nikezeus are expected to increase substantially 
still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains it has been estimated that spending by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than $### million in fiscal #### to more than $# billion by #### and that the electronic industrys share of these expenditures will be closer to ##% than the current ##% 
although the impact of these increases on our industrys shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least $# billion paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $## billion compared to $## billion in #### 
informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late ####s under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing industrial process control and information storage and retrieval in the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright 
sales should slightly exceed #### however and reach $## billion in addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year 
the markets for electronic parts in #### have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates 
sales of transistors in #### exceeded $### million compared to $### million in #### despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types production totalled about ### million units against ## million in #### and i look for a further gain to ### million units worth approximately $### million in #### 
in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in #### with total sales increasing about #% to $### billion despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally as i have indicated above i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the fullyear figures close to those of #### 
and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the ####s the appointment of gilbert b devey as general manager of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut a leading manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical controls has been announced by david b peck vice president special products 
mr brown will at the same time undertake expansion of vectrols custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff mr deveys new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of spragues special products group which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components packaged component assemblies and high temperature magnet wires 
during world war # he was a lieutenant commander in the united states navy mr devey is a graduate of the massachusetts institute of technology and attended the united states naval academy postgraduate school specializing in electronic engineering 
mr devey is a member of the institute of radio engineers and is chairman of the electronic industries association committee on printed and modular components mr brown wellknown englishborn inventor prior to founding vectrol was at various times section leader in radio research at metropolitan vickers electrical co ltd 
director of engineering at philco of great britain ltd and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at the brush development co cleveland ohio he has a bachelor of science from the university of manchester england 
he is a fellow of the american institute of electrical engineers and a senior member of the institute of radio engineers he is a member of the institution of electrical engineers london a registered professional engineer in connecticut and ohio and a chartered electrical engineer in great britain 
the appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electromagnetic compatability problems between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters 
since faculty see themselves as selfemployed professionals rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course the faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship 
he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration how well do faculty members govern themselves 
they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government they too need to learn to delegate 
although faculties insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government there are nevertheless several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege 
he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the actionoriented faculty by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments 
despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration complaints of a lack of communication persist the cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose 
the need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly 
success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogatives patience and persistence the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands 
they serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to toplevel decision making the president who appoints strong men who have an allcollege or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance 
the administration at the same time looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments one way that this can be done other than by hiring new highpriced professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance 
by supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to 
an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere for the maintenance of a longterm program the departments and particularly their chairmen are strategic 
to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly at some colleges and universities a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates 
they can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work at one university the president cites the faculty review committee as a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty 
the president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind no good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria 
there are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the mans former achievements 
in particular the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale on those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action 
recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institutionwide goals each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates 
in the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned in the second more shops laboratories and staff will be required 
trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed 
more than one president has found that a longrange plan helps him to attract major gifts it inspires confidence in his institutions determination to establish goals and to achieve them 
the first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside consultants or by a combination of the two it should sternly appraise curricula faculty organization buildings faculty work loads and potential for growth in stature and size 
some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others 
to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a universitys instructional program 
more often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data the presidents opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new fundraising efforts 
when the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the presidents budget to which his faith and credit are committed its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment 
he reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship 
otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy at worst and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning in the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the joneses in all branches 
here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role in the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention 
higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income just as the entire faculty should know the presidents educational philosophy and objectives so should nonacademic officers 
a president is frequently besieged to serve in nonacademic civic and governmental capacities to make speeches to lay groups and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus since he can neither accept nor reject them all he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations 
it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco for it seems that barco fancying himself a ladies man and why not after seven marriages 
mills secured barcos photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to the hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of cal barco on their way they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants 
they headed in that direction and at san juan capistrano bythesea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drivein eating a hot tamale at the moment barcos back was to the road so he didnt see the detectives close in on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they proceeded to search 
the detectives placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered 
the detective commenting on barcos behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged that he was a more or less harmless nut however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an attempt to take his own life 
the jail authorities attaching no particular significance to the episode offered barco whisky to revive him but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more was thought of the matter 
a man of vaulting ambition with one eye on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity it was reported to welchs office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide 
the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly 
itll be a lot better if you come clean but with welchs relentless pursuit of the subject barco finally broke and started confessing to one murder after another 
but if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial but to welchs chagrin the police captain poohpoohed welchs credulity in barcos confession 
then for the first time since his arrest a glint of spirit lit barcos eyes  well for ten years ive been murdering women 
the next day the police captain in derision organized what he termed welchs wild goose chase for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it even in hollywood 
barco his state of apprehension gone never to return had assumed a matteroffactness which remained his principal attitude from that time on he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica 
the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barcos pride was aroused with greater precision he again paced off a location this time a little more to the left 
the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object the digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderers hollywood sport shirts 
his elation grew as barcos seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him 
it was apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power as da to drag every possible sensation into the case every new scandal which would provide more copy for marshalls pen would thus mean more publicity for welch 
once there the da with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headlines violas multiple romances viola lake an addict downfall of another film idol it would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayors throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl 
it wasnt long before i sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for violas destruction he was bitter and resentful toward her personally resentful 
i did not rest until i had tracked the mystery down one day over a year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel 
she arrived late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor 
and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch 
a little later the district attorney woke up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was to preside he made his way to his hosts bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed 
the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined the incident aside from reflecting on welchs political career had all but wrecked his home life 
by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion during these first days of the trial i didnt have as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked 
we couldnt be seen together for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent i couldnt invite viola to our house for mother snobbishly refused to receive her 
there mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the budweisers of beer derivation the chalmers of underwear origin and the heinzes whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles i hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats 
in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoipolloi mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school 
however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world society and even alas to my own mother when i arrived at violas i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen 
there was to be roast chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes all chosen prepared and cooked by viola herself i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem but his agony could have been no greater 
i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly heres a household hint if you cant find your children and get tired of calling them pick up the phone 
jennie and miranda twined themselves around me murmuring endearments louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency 
i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice 
under the circumstances i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it was that hank and i be there i discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living room 
resolving to get something done i started in on the dishes what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink 
francesca and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia we didnt even know them till about a month after we moved at that time they had called on us after i met fran at a pta meeting and had taken us in hand socially 
the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin herb an expert on narrow ties thin lapels and swatches was mens fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation 
she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which was successful terrible but successful 
they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda everyone was very high on rome that year 
they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names  you are bound to get involved with people when you have children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands but people who do things 
their house was a centuriesold colonial which they had had restored guided by an eminent architect and updated and added on to it had a gourmets corner instead of a kitchen a breakfast room a luncheon room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud 
their two boys were well adjusted and like their parents always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences francesca and herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects expensive but not necessarily valuable contemporary things 
sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the ss no one could dislike them i thought 
it seemed indeed that their house was not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing names 
she always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy and that koussevitzkys second cousin was an intimate of theirs i wouldnt have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally unreal 
yes blanche was very very sweet being in her company was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness oh my souffle has collapsed 
if blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little valueless things after five minutes with blanche one might welcome the astringency of grazie who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francescas perle mesta 
they were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals for social leadership grazie was mean quietly mean and bitterly unfunnily sarcastic 
grazie had a small slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast she lived in an ultramodern house whose decoration appointments paint and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring 
her uniform was of rich raw silk in a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen fish stick the husbands of these women and others i had met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at least indistinguishable 
one or two were writers of books each had developed a hairtrigger chuckle and the habit of saying zounds 
they were sincere men of the toohearty handclasp and the urgent smile these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed mistyeyed with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting 
they were always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops  i thought and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier 
i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $##### yearly people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person 
who were more ingratiating than gracious more personalities than persons in my estimation they were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka 
reverently and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about kafka not having read kafka they were i felt people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were 
i made plans for the afternoon doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen then i remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week 
i dug around and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devilsfood cake with chocolate icing  sometimes i think you need only one rule for cooking if you cant put garlic in it put chocolate in it 
then jennie closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said take my hand louise needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise 
 it is as though i said on the historic threehour coasttocoast radio broadcast which i bought following father coughlin and preempting the eddie cantor manhattan merrygoround and major bowes shows that man in the white house like some despot of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie  my impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis 
the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended on the athens that was mighty metronome sacking and despoiling with their bolshevistic battle cry of soak the rich after an unspeakable siege lasting the better part of two months it was announced that the studio owed the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while i who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned and the little i legally inherited as morris helpless relict was stung with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to wipe out all but a fraction of my poor hardcomeby savings 
it was then that i availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional i fought like a tigress but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court #### mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me 
i was ready like portia to present my own brief but the supreme court wouldnt even hear my case 
again my name was on all the front pages i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence 
albert einstein was quoted as saying the workings of the womans mind amaze me henry ford spoke of me as utterly astounding 
not only were the court costs prohibitive but i was subjected to crippling fines in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid debts which the government claimed that metronome and i owed a severe financial blow nor as manny said had the notoriety done my career any good 
i point now with pride to the fact that long ere the committee on unamerican activities the minute women the economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations were so much as heard of i was hollywoods leading bulwark against communism fighting singlehandedly creeping socialism against such insuperable odds as the fasciocommunist troops of the nra pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twentytwo million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through the transparent ruse of regular relief checks needless to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period 
such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to oscar winning performances i tried my hardest with little help may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside pressures were too severe 
never a quick study he now made no attempt to learn his lines and many a mile of film was wasted many a scene sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians was taken thirty forty fifty times because miss poitrines costar and helpmate had never learned his part each time letch went up in his lines i was the one to be patient helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament profanity and abuse blaming others going into sulks and on more occasions than i care to count storming off the set for the rest of the day 
it was i who paid for our little home the food the liquor the servants even letchs bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic club never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw 
more than once i was confronted by professional gamblers bookies loan sharks gangsters thugs and finger men people of a class i did not even know existed to repay my husbands staggering losses or else i shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children 
 ah youre too old was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested starting a family letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter 
her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau belletch i had neglected to consider a room for babydear so there was no place to put her anyhow  i sometimes feel that god in his infinite wisdom wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory 
yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say with faint heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse 
a splash party at the new pool which i had built in the hope of keeping letch away from public beaches when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour a lovely epiphany party at errol flynns on which sacred occasion letch stole away with an unknown starlet leaving me high and dry to get home as best i could 
as mrs letch feeley was it any wonder that i once the social arbiter of filmdom was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the astaires the coopers the gables the colmans the rathbones the taylors the thalbergs and such devout closely knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys as letchs antisocial conduct increased our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable screenland gathering 
our last joint venture sainted lady a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of americas first saint in november #### was a fiasco from start to finish as i was playing mother cabrini the picture was actually all mine with nearly every scene built around me 
and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf did he trouble to memorize the very small part which i had tailormade to his specifications a role eventually cut down to three short speeches 
the shooting went on for eight months most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling bookies illegal gambling dens a certain residential club for young actresses more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club 
he made many tasteless irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title role but about religion in general by the time the film was released we were three million dollars overspent war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini 
only george santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote miss poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed by hollywood in a rare fit of anger and spite i farmed out my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment 
it turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things in clothes letch simply did not project 
it was a potboiler made on a shoestring and not the sort of film i like as all i had to do was look blank and scream a great deal my heart was not in it but oddly enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my career 
letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy advice would help me 
 what is letch interested in  bookies booze and babes momma said bluntly 
 i cant turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon i said up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess he hadnt even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadnt found it 
the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately as a result life had become a kind of continuous makeready 
then at last his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon accompanied by his dogs he had almost forgotten them although they had played such an important part in his early dreams 
they were constantly assuring you that you were one of the worlds great guys regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would never find out and even if they did it would make no difference 
what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons you certainly couldnt take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns 
it worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it 
was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with 
did men become perfectionists as they grew older polishing polishing reluctant to let go it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent to blink their eyes 
and then again perhaps the reason why he couldnt find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement reading roaming gardening lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because he didnt want to do them they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn 
this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch 
he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop 
he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nails levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for add things as you find you need em 
after all if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using the recently purchased second car 
he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall 
in front of it would be his workbench the old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more only this time he couldnt pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away 
how did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter after the pegboard there would be the paneling 
perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget but then when you stuck things into the holes why didnt they come right out again 
a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didnt wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it mr mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and twobyfours which properly handled would he had assured him turn into a workbench 
mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that 
then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on mr crumb was laid up with a bad cold 
the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job that was why he hadnt been able to finish the porch 
carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mothers son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twentyfive dollars a day was working on the school job there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way 
mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night if he was sober which was doubtful hed have him get in touch with mr crombie 
he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasnt nobody with you so mr crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr blatzs mind from funny things 
while mr blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty 
 now he said we got to put in some outlets for them power tools then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an i guess were about through down here 
 by the way said mr blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools needs extra voltage before you use em the light companys got to run in a heavy line and youll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits 
instead of being depressed by this news mr crombie was actually relieved at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools 
as usual mrs crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils mr blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair 
he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions mr crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression 
mr crombie couldnt remember his saying any such thing  oh thats wonderful cried mrs crombie 
doors that wont open and doors that wont close and shelves and broken  but those are the things i built the workshop for protested mr crombie 
 ive been waiting to get these things done for months she said  we wont live long enough if i wait for you besides which you dont need to worry therell be plenty more 
nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences ben franklin said clearly spoken mr fogg 
and a witty american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he cant understand his own meaning there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies 
one species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition  did you or did you not say what i said you said because jane said you never said what i said 
such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours ambiguity of a nonrepetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in 
 i wrote bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didnt mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind and he seems to have misunderstood me evidently bill was another of those men who simply dont understand women 
 mr jones you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it 
they recall byrons classic comment i wish he would explain his explanation similarly when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion lincoln refused to make any further statement 
the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks  senator said an interviewer your constituents cant understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question 
the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word 
now can you tell me who was drunk the man his wife or me the woodenleg gag of vaudeville another standby of this sort had endless variations

in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman excuse me but when we came out we found that we had left my daughters handbag and my wifes behind journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips 
classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions readers of the readers digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips like the ad in a california paper that advertised house for rent 
since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples son and daughter of local couple married 
a weekly newspaper reported a local romance and the couple were married last saturday thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays an item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription adding i personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband 
we have complete facilities to accommodate ### people the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical 
samples he walked in upon her invitation not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese 
 while henry morgan was escorting miss vera green from the church social last saturday night a savage dog attacked them and bit mr morgan on the public square such items recall the california journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star the area in which miss n was injured is spectacularly scenic 
when a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus he replied no it was in the stomach strangely enough this always brought the house down 
a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctors notes on an emergency case 
after a moment of thought her mind cleared and in the interest of clarity she typed into the record shot in the woods there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations 
 i want the fish served whole with head and tail the epicure explained and serve it with lemon in mouth  thats silly lemon in mouth she said 
so she brought the fish in whole and she carried a lemon in her mouth another specimen of such doubleentendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store 
the puzzled saleslady inquired how large is your house madam this saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department 
the comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person place time or thing 
 oh im so delighted to meet you she gushed  it was only the other day that i saw something of yours about something or other in some magazine 
 i may be back he explained and then again i may not  yes sir she said is that definite 
the daughter replied oh i had dinner with well you dont know him but hes awfully nice and we went to a couple of places i dont suppose youve heard of them and we finished up at a cute little night club i forget the name of it why its all right isnt it mother 
 its only that i like to know where you go no less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergymans sermon 
this clergyman should have referred to shakespeares dictum soso is a good very good very excellent maxim indefinite reference also carries doublemeaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another 
this is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool four trucks to fort mason gym ### tonight for hauling girls to dance the bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off 
 what are my chances for taking joes place  if you can fix it up with the undertaker returned the politician its all right with me 
 what have you got on today  a blue suit he answered 
another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb when a question contains two verbs the response does not make clear which of them is being answered 
finally he asked do you object to petting  thats one thing ive never done she said promptly 
 no she smiled objected replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive doubleentendre 
another less ambiguous case read as follows the bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction if you are thinking of giving him a berth be sure to make it a wide one 
ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference one said when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it and within a few hours its gone 
itwit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit an excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone doctor please come over right away 
my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed momentum weightlessness or distance from earth but is a matter of the development of the human mind after gagarin became the greatest man in the world for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism moreland wrote me a letter in which he said i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum or how far it can fly 
 i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy i told him at which he started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling hand  i seem to remember he said that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live 
 i was wrong i admitted  comedy didnt die it just went crazy 
we now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes magazines known as horror comics and sick comedians there are even publications called sick and mad 
 i woke up this morning moreland said paraphrasing lewis carroll do you want to hear the paraphrase 
 just barely he said and repeated his paraphrase the time has come the walrus said to speak of manic things of shots and shouts and sealing dooms of commoners and kings moreland fixed us each another drink and said for gods sake tell me something truly amusing 
 oh yes the other day i reread some of emersons english traits and there was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany more than a hundred years ago in the railway station at berlin a uniformed attendant was chanting foreigners this way 
i took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink and said i admit that going back to ralph waldo emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy  whats the matter with the music 
 lets talk about books moreland said  i am told that in america you have nonbooks by nonwriters brought out by nonpublishers for nonreaders 
 speaking of nonism the other day in a story about a sitdown demonstration the paris herald tribune wrote the nonviolence became noisier and then eichmann was quoted as saying in nonenglish that hitlers plan to exterminate the jews was nonsense 
 they require for existence a brave spirit and a high heart and where do you find these in our present era of science and angst the heart has been downgraded to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs 
 last year your tennessee williams told our dilys powell in a television program that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart like almost everybody else he confused the heart both as organ and as symbol with the disturbed psyche the deranged glands and the jumpy central nervous system 
the sentimental pure heart of galahad is gone with the knightly years but i still believe in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks  we no longer have tom moores and longfellows heart for any fate either i said 
 one day our species promises coexistence and the next day it threatens coextinction we sat for a while drinking in silence 
when it was worn in the breast or even on the sleeve we at least knew where it was  you have visited england five times in the past quartercentury i believe my host said 
 i would say depressed not impressed i told him  i should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas involving clergymen and parishioners psychiatrists and patients 
 do you think we need a new henry james to reexplore the angloamerican scene  or perhaps a new noel coward 
i myself hear it said constantly in drawingrooms in them there is usually a group of angloamericans with tragicomic problems worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire 
 too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock  furiouser and furiouser i said 
it now means ominous as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor disturbing as when one says that a friend is acting funny 
moreland sat brooding for a full minute during which i made each of us a new drink he took his glass clinked it against mine and said toujours gai what the hell 
it now means in my country homosexual i said  oh i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance 
my host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks  is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species 
 do you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously she told the sheep the world is coming to an end 
the sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh  that is only partly nonnonsense he began 
the rhinos would panic screaming help  if that can be screamed in their language 
 nongod no i said  the political and intellectual left began fighting humor and comedy years ago because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage such as satire and irony such as humor and comedy 
in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as ed wynn but like caesar he has only one joke so far as i can find out 
why in the name of his nongod doesnt he vary it a bit  such as sending the cat to guard the mice or the falcon to protect the dove or most terribly sharp of all the human being to save humanity 
 what a nasty fall was there moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again and then came back and sat down restively 
in our age of science and angst it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space  the human ego being what it is i put in science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tubenosed fruit bats 
 now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again moreland protested  not in the largest sense of the words i said 
why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else forty years ago an english writer w l george dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example that saint george for merry england would not start a spirit half so quickly as strike frogeating frenchmen dead 
it isnt what the ideologist believes in but what he hates that puts the world in jeopardy this is the force in our time and in every other time that urges the paranoiac and the manicdepressive to become head of a state 
there is a bitter satire for a future writer in that  great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable i said 
i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about one day the children had wanted to get up onto general burnsides horse 
arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by arlene had a hard voice too this time 
but then arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasnt for these dear children the policeman got a confused funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now look here lady i know you got to entertain these kids and all 
arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said yes sir the policeman walked on but he looked back once 
arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area and they had told their mother about the tumbles 
and so they were consistently true to their principles  never mind arlene had said after the policeman had left having pursued the usual uncooperative course of grownups 
asked the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene 
and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time first arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults 
 just you wait said arlene again as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement  is it anything like cookedover oatmeal 
one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously particularly your very very serious questions those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest 
just long enough to make you feel important  now said arlene eventually making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable 
the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever then arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful 
 imagine being able to laugh and wink when youre like the top part of that picture frame at home one of them said  im general burnsides horse upside down arlene said sort of gaspingly for her even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position 
then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous smile she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time but it made their lips and eyelids tremble 
 this time arlene said and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking youre going to tell me what i am and what im doing it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse 
it was general burnsides horse running in a circle his legs shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders 
the other remarked in a happy laughter thats a funny old horse the first one said he sure does shake 
but it was even funnier after they had been told their father when he came back from those many business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox 
then they had to get up and be general burnside all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their legs out 
 you ought to shake arlene advised them she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like my sister kate 
they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling  imagine you wont get your allowance if youre caught not smiling or smiling with your lips trembling too much arlene suggested 
 im sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us 
 i suppose you all were playing and forgot  yes maam the children chorused heartily 
and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open  arlenes a good girl my uncle remarked to us 
 she really is a dear little thing my mother agreed she was biting into a small red radish 
also she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting 
and she would snatch the fingerheld half of the radish out to where she could inspect it one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief 
but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public later on the children told her further about somersaulting 
and awfully kind of arlene she told us later  but do you know something curious 
but i would not pamper myself in that silly way i opened the window and threw the radish out 
for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain a friend of my fathers came to dinner 
as a result he was persuaded out to dinner as a matter of fact this happened every four or five months 
sometimes as at this juncture he did not he liked children in a loathsome kind of way 
when he had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action not bothering to look this evening they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them 
they were pushed gently into the room by arlene whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door  tell mr gorboduc what youre doing these days my mother advised the children ceremonially 
this could be told chiefly from a sort of headtossing and prancing a horselike balkiness of demeanor possibly the coconutcontaining dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration 
 we go to the park with this nice lady one of them said  you dont step on the flowers do you 
mr gorboduc took a swig of his sherry he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs 
but this time she was nervous she was open mr gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again 
this was delivered in a forthright way without coyness and overpretended interest an admirable way with children only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command 
 we bump one said and the other went on to development of the idea 
 say that again she pleaded she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass

the dharma dictionary a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian protosenility cults its somewhat off the beaten track to be sure but therein lies its variety and charm 
likewise and equally fascinating is the news that such unlikely synonyms as pratakku sweathruna and the tonguetwister nnuolapertaritvuhkartibirifw all originated in the same village in batharonwalli province and are all used to express sentiments concerning british imperialism the terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean but before you start spouting them to your date it might be best to find out if he was a member of major pockmansters delhi regiment since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit 
as you have doubtless guessed already the plot is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory for example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was doris the english equivalent when passed through middlegaelic derivations of wilhelmina 
in this manner he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the english at dunkirk as we find out at the end it is not the stool symbolizing doris therefore the english that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind 
after a few tortuous moments of wondering who he is the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue and we realize that neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture the effect needless to say is almost terrifying and though at times a bit obscure the film is certainly a muchneeded catharsis for the repressed moviegoer 
those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brestsilevniov festival in august #### will certainly welcome his return to public notice and it is not unlikely that even as the great bach lay dormant for so many years so has the erudite ingenious salfininistas passed through his purgatory of neglect 
as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and rattzhenfuut concertos including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza which was included at the conductors insistence a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible indianapolis movement in the baslot 
for example to move as the score requires from the lowest fmajor register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same time even one of the ### fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider and it is to the flautists credit that he remained silent throughout the passage we would have preferred however to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording since it mars an otherwise sober if not lofty performance 
for the last two years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of socalled nondramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer the latest and significantly greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of bashos classic froghaiku by roger entwhistle a former university of maryland chemistry instructor 
the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress the police and an intruding government tutor 
leaving the theatre after the performance i had a flash of intuition that life after all as rilke said is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middleaged steam shovel

dear sirs let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds wherever you are the collective by which i address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves 
ie burglars who rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hotslough prowlers those who work while the occupants are home since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that i am taunting you as socially inferior 
above all disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets dart or to shame you into rectitude my object rather is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict 
quite candidly fellows i wouldnt be in your shoes for all the rice in china as youve doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate them briefly 
hastening to the attic the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there what you were looking for unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens eludes me but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumedoak victrola 
you then descended one story glommed a television set from the music room the only constructive feature of your visit by the way and returning to the ground floor entered the master bedroom from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jadehandled magnifying glass 
then having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you im sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake 
fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches in time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce riddling you with frambesia the kings evil sheep rot and clonic spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release

in that case listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss a couple of years back i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a coffin turn 
after a while we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it our suspicions eventually centered by the process of elimination on a grocers boy a thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead 
i learned for example that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws 
in short and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber well the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldnt retaliate and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself 
 now hes bought it said my wife contentedly  no divinity will hold still for that 
he had aged thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with wrinkles as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice either an ape specter or abe spector a processserver we couldnt determine which 
the grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi and let him go the beautiful the satisfying part of his disintegration however was the masterly way the buddha polished him off 
his hubris deficiency of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top he evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks and quickly superseded his boss 
he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in extremis  i wouldnt be in his shoes for all the rice in china 
however one looks at it therefore id say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy the inventory you acquired from me isnt going to be easy to move 
additionally since youre going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue yaws delhi boil the granville wilt liver fluke bilharziasis and a host of other complications of the hex youve aroused you mustnt expect to be lionized socially my advice if you live long enough to continue your vocation is that the next time youre attracted by the exotic pass it up its nothing but a headache 
the doors of the d train slid shut and as i dropped into a seat and exhaling looked up across the aisle the whole aviary in my head burst into song she was a living doll and no mistake the blueblack bang the wide cheekbones oliveflushed that betrayed the cherokee strain in her midwestern lineage and the mouth whose only fault in the novelists carping phrase was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous 
they neither liked nor disliked the old man to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass and at noon and at six each evening its tone repetitive monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets 
or the smell of thick tomato paste the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in flydotted cheesecloth or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights 
they never called him by name although he had one filippo rossi thats what he was called in the old country 
but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession 
the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened but the past was dead here as the present was dead 
and once she too ignored him with a tiny furpiece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her satincovered buttocks down the street before him and didnt stop 
the way she strutted down the street the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both without looking at him without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in it and never came back 
she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from torino just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought she could carry her head higher than ours 
calloused fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted never to be tweezed away mauvecolored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of mans tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again 
it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner his voice had not commanded her to stop 
but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him  and his eyes those miniature sundials of variegated yellow had not altered their expression or direction 
perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife but when he called for his withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar 
for all he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the outskirts of philadelphia it could have been bari or chieti for the way it smelled 
or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness 
sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city sameness lined the streets with twostory houses the color of ash 
it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors even the stablegarage which housed nothing now but the scent of rot had a lawn before it 
the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it only one house on the street had no lawn before it 
above it from a secondstory showroom wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood did the old man remember them there 
only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences where one mans property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy love and hatred and fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines 
the old man silently fed upon these streets waiting for what and for whom only he could tell and would not 
the old mans son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich at fifteen he didnt care that he had no mother that he couldnt remember her face or her touch 
he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage and he couldnt have cared less about that either to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep 
he would not be like the rich americans who lived in whitecolumned houses on the other side of the park he would not ride the eightthirty local to the city each morning 
he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at your service he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove his gloves and light and smoke 
he called to his sister on the porch above the steps she was only ten months older than he 
she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking torn pales 
all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii 
the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed a sullen quality even though the boy could not see them he knew they were clouded by distance 
pompeii called again laura but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it 
well what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him 
above the tongue an aged yellow eye sallow and timecast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin stared unfalteringly at him  christ sake goat git 
soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch his head undulated gradually covering space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats 
the boys fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting in what he did above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud 
but the boy could see only the goats belly the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in it 
there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the devil his due in the meantime six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeiis shaved hair edged up close to him 
he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones to romeo concettas idiot brother pompeii expected romeos small body to sink closer and closer to the ground 
people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it the room filled with smoke and maggies head throbbed with excitement and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldnt bear to do anything to quench it 
in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food 
she was so heavy that maggies arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her maggie couldnt seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back 
worry had a great deal to do with it stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his fathers office taking what salary his father could hand out to him 
maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things 
she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again  i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something maggie said 
 i should think so eugenia said  for one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day 
she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck  shell be just as beautiful in something that doesnt have to be ironed eugenia said 
 evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from bests liliputian bazaar in new york and im sick and tired of hearing about evadna mae evans  well now maggie you dont have to snap at me eugenia said 
i do seem to snap at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money lets make a list of your assets 
when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures  i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers eugenia said 
 you might set up a dress shop in the living room  every woman in the block has tried that 
you could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes and grandma isnt strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i 
 oh im sure i could do that maggie said  but it really wouldnt be fair taking your jobs away from you 
maggie was looking much happier already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldnt be ashamed of it  and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time 
 what are you going to do with your feet so you dont waste anything she said oh eugenia i wish 
it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days 
it had a look of grim stark realism resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of the sprawling bumptious openhanded greedy western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines outside government agencies 
there never had been a need felt for such facilities that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected by discriminatory freight rates 
and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay the government offices were being opened but they werent being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything 
it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day 
about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day just dropping the babys bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster 
cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and an electric heater in grandmas room 
the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms they moved maggies bed and the babys basket there and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds 
 you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly eugenia hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin 
 plenty of people are poor all their lives  plenty of people havent our brains and talent 
 youre working up to something and if you dont watch out youll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy family is superior to everything even a depression  the only thing that worries me is how im going to prove it eugenia said 
she didnt want to be the only one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater hope wouldnt hear of it and she took the heater back to grandmas room and grandma took it back to hopes room and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire 
eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldnt have the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in  thrifty of her to use it up 
hed mentioned it himself at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny had jilted him for roy robards  it was plain as the nose on your face that theyre laughing about it mamma 
 we will both go back laban  let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma 
tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny this trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact 
frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back theyre not going to laugh at the fairbrothers and labans very long 
she was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable  make your confession to god kizzie dear not to the congregation 
i was so cruel to tolley so unfair he is coming back isnt he frank 
he questioned gods taking time to telegraph the message but he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it if he died before she did she would never be unable to resist opening it 
it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing  youve told god frank he said 
reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash surely now his beloved son could rest in peace 
a beautiful and haunting line a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and perhaps he did but there were great satisfactions even for a small man 
there lay grand fairs quinzaine his own young parents graves but new life and promise for his sons grandsons he poured his thimble of wine for the toast hed made so often 
mr robards jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood who called him that was kind but too easygoing it didnt bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her 
simply call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pga and cun major frank mr robards laughed said hed feel a damn fool plainout couldnt do that even to please her 
and dont tell me you didnt at church sunday he really hadnt meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr robards 
another weakness far more irritating than his manner of speaking which he made only token effort to change was his devotion to that old horse of tolleys but mr robards now oh my yes indeed yes 
he with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or whatnots out there in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin mare the revolting gunny for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall 
 stand back miss jen shes oneasy of your scarf never quit that you sorl devil 
she musnt annoy gunny whose foal was due then too listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist fairs poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it 
human birth was no novelty to mr robards tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested 
the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure he would be in the barn or riding for the veterinarian 
yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been jenny wished now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldnt have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets 
rhyme em up cute arcilla flotilla edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself and 
 she was mighty good to you past times an thisll fetch her now she must be thinking of a boyname something special 
strong too up on his legs when he was an hour old  why dont you name him jesus christ 
of course she wasnt herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didnt seem to rise with it those elegant at home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes again and had the house all trimmed up hadnt brought many callers in two whole months 
miss kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married though youd have thought a namesake would have brought her round oh shed come to see them once left silver teething rings for all of the trips 
more and more these days shed been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her over to tillies and nicks his own old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the house everybody friendly inside making a todo over the babies dressed like dollies though he was glad she got on well with his young folks she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too 
he didnt tell miss jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit if he ever did such a thing again shed die of shame 
 a swell party send an invite to everbody but them those folks you met at the galt house the ones ive got to know in this new jockey club affair the whole dang neighborhood well have oystchers couple barl oystchersll fetch in a crowd any time 
he was downright worried about her but there was one more thing he could try zion was surprised when roys buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town 
her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didnt notice it as she settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were getting on he swung in through his own wide gateway 
shell relish the sight of a friendly face miss kiz wont care your comin will she 
 he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room the absolution of doatys last will and testament was proof enough of that 
she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty she was running away that she had left something more behind her than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel 
there had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently tempted 
in winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge there had been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils 
there had been supper parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun around which the blackwell planets revolved mama had died before the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles 
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta 
only at this moment perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in doatys bed she found herself examining how others might regard her perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice 
if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone 
the birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room touching sill and door table and chair and all of doatys flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf before anything else she would go to doatys grave with flowers from doatys forgotten garden 
she closed her eyes remembering the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls it had always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray 
the garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness leaning out she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it 
it was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme dun certain age feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs 
feeling protective toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and ladys bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly 
henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty  rummaging in the dew said rosa coldly 
she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door 
the cemetery slumbered just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity 
now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches 
he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic 
 im taking them to the cemetery said henrietta out of a vague feeling of hospitality  theyll be takin me next he said pleasantly but not so soons they plan 
its dryin myself out that does it  youd like to hear how i go about it 
he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text 
henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense  rests the tissues he said and pacifies the system 
 dont remember do you she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away 
he had never spoken once to the awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishingboat captain and powerful like the sea it must be that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half his senses 
 not so wells i remember you he said ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man 
 cant blame a man for leavin his wife he said quite cheerfully  left mine many a time only she never knew it 
he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly  youd be the one to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different since all actions had their own laws 
well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow 
she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man  youve not had your breakfast yet grandad 
he beat the air with his stick and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones  hes lowly today his granddaughter said wearily and bent to pick it up 
 if it aint an idea she said how comes it you can drink beer but not water he looked piously to heaven and said beer dont affect the tissues none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence 
 youll be visiting miss doaty maam the woman she must have been a tiny baby when hetty and delia had stood arm in arm watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own 
she put a strong hand under the old mans arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength 
henrietta looked down at her bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their journeys way again leaving the village street and crossing the first field folly dancing ahead of her at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like sheep 
the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty 
she sat down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with seadamp her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss the days sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished she had brought her parasol if only to shade doatys flowers 
she remembered suddenly a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in hand hoping and fearing ghosts the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still traces of the mysterious ainu strain 
they had white skins and blue eyes all their men were bearded and many of their women were beautiful 
most of them have been assimilated but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honeyinthesun tint of the invaders from the south tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions 
her nose was higher of bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about 
she had been in japan just one week it was an alien land and she hated it intensely 
anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward 
at present the doctors main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because the work involved setting off nerveshattering blasts at all hours tommy was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients 
she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck this was one of the navys crossroads you find them all around the world 
sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here if tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach 
she felt rather than saw the approach of the goodlooking young man he came through from the fleet bar which was stag with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried 
he was perhaps a trifle tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant 
there was a fiftyfifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different japan did something to a man and it wasnt just japan either because the same thing applied anywhere overseas 
it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different 
maybe you likee date with me  i dont believe i know you and i cant understand your quaint brand of english it was meant to be english wasnt it 
at least he had the decency to blush she thought you see i thought i mean i really had no idea 
then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy slang he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool 
it hadnt been this way in college or in nurses training it wasnt this way in the hospital at san diego 
nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places nobody had suggested that she wasnt american there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces 
now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn four little japanese waitresses were murdering the english language at the counter yuki kobayashi happened to be one of them 
for a steak sandwich or kohi futotsu two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed 
the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children she told herself rebelliously and with pride i am an american 
but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese 
she had been sent to the wrong place for duty there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward 
now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt lonesome and putupon 
she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion 
then after a while she went to her mirror she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men 
there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone cheerful she promised that she would soon take a few days leave and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima which was not very far from yokosuka 
tommy of course had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are better than strangers actually this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water 
but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didnt know 
the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up 
the war found him much too early and its perils and especially its awful boredom were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found any stabilizing sobering influence he remained young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor 
he was doing thirty years and the navy would take care of him the job security enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed forces is a wonderful thing 
he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired doc had been under restriction to the ship since the bustard left subic 
at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suited him quite well 
a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange after supper doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family 
 ill be there but ill walk doc said  ive got to run an errand on the way 
how he wondered does one enjoy ones spare time he considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk 
perhaps golf with a fashionable companion but hed lost his clubs hadnt played in years there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog 
i could he thought take a long walk but where  you missed it buzzs voice said you should have gone over to the pagan room with us 
 hi buzz owen said  i went over to the willows and dropped two notes 
imagine a stag dinner with toodle williams owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next to his but he hadnt come to reno for stag dinners 
buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the door 
ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last he was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door 
 our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska we call them laysisters and they go among the eskimos making friends and bringing the light 
 you see she said looking past him into the room where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i cant understand the many hardships they have to undergo smug owen thought smug and sappy 
it gave her a lewd winking effect  have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo 
 i dont know much about them owen admitted but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do people dont know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that 
that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the pitch several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice 
 im sure the hotel doesnt know youre wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers doors and talking down eskimos  oh i just come once a week 
do you know these women go all through alaska and they dont have the proper facilities they travel in pairs as much as a hundredandfifty miles a day 
owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldnt help himself  thats hardly a christian approach she remonstrated 
those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses but they dont get top personnel our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics 
 god doesnt have any appliance or cosmetics he said heatedly before he caught himself he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation 
 you know he said getting a grip on himself i think youre going to have to excuse me  i can imagine she said 
 i have no card she said bitterly  you havent been listening to what ive been telling you 
she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down the hall 
he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail 
his lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last years exemptions he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced 
the glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot 
the tables were all spinning the dice rattling the bar crowded just to test himself he played roulette for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars 
the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon there were more women than men in the place but he couldnt find a flowerpot 
the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful 
 i wonder if they did eat each other at the end owen mused he sat down next to a heavilyupholstered blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes 
she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the laysisters depending on her support a driedup cowboy sat down next to him in the blondes place 
 what you need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen play  you cant build on your hitandmiss fiveseventeen 
 i keep all these plays in this little black book and i watch over a twelvehour period to find out what numbers are repeating im always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack 
dont you have to spend any time on your ranch im with the barh pushing a horse called sparky 
this sparky can rack and singlefoot and hes the fastest thing in washoe county i figure if i can get any kind of publicity campaign going ill land him on tv you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero 
hes a pinto and he photographs wonderfully five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars 
when he looked in the back mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays featured as an added attraction 
he had no great prejudice against shills the management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points 
he wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him he passed two brides both wearing orchids and they made him feel a little sad 
he was shorter and fatter than owen who felt good standing next to him  were all going over to lake tahoe and try our luck at calneva buzz explained still instigating 
he started out as a stickman then became a pit boss until the club found him crossroading he was knocking down checks at faro 
 well okay buzz said owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldnt pyramid with any consecutive success 
a short platinum blonde in a bursting sunsuit addressed him she looked wellfed and prosperous but he didnt get the impression he was being propositioned the way hed been hoping 
 stake me she said and let me at those dice well get it in a hurry and get it out 
 if you go broke she said smiling up at him ill leave you  sounds like real love owen said 
 my names gisele the blonde said after she ordered a scotch my mother wanted to call me sylphide but it sounded too affected 
alexander said answer me properly spencer spencer was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing i want to say captain 
philip spencer had coldbloodedly planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers 
hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort  what is the next step captain 
he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer 
there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain heiser breathless and wildeyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places 
an african knife and battleax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencers possession and that 
who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him 
the aimless milling about of what had been a welltrained wellorganized crew struck alexander with horror he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction 
i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey 
alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed their strategy was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip spencers unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated 
spencers potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three by glance and signal one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson 
wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny 
three days had passed since spencers arrest and each day had brought new dangers new fears gansevoort said it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely 
from actions aboard it is easy to guess that spencers boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate  well heiser ventured why dont we hold an investigation with questioning and 
 there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what 
mr heiser does this sound like a truly workable plan to you do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now 
they are about to do so at any moment as it is all that is needed is for one man to feel selfconfident enough to take the lead 
we are going to be rushed and murdered  that is extravagant language mr wales 
 we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound  of course i agree with the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate 
he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands 
 under arms day and night watch and watch about those of us present the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers 
and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navys implacable laws 
he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven 
one did ones best and if fortune smiled there was a reward one did ones best and if fortune frowned an eighteenyearold boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard ones ship 
god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with an egotists rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist 
to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price 
sternfaced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger 
he said captain may i speak please captain i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship 
 you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt  i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent 
 surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything  no cromwell i did not find your name 
he said cromwell is telling you the truth the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell 
and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a kinship with spencer here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable 
he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune the redhaired captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authority was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer 
but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the redhaired captain they would be each others undoing 
 i tell you he is innocent  and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word 
 nothing to lose either spencer  thats true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation 
 i am innocent captain cromwell said again  before god captain i am innocent 
no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwells hands while spencer whispered explanations  i thought midshipman rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him geometry 
this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized some of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencers followers 
a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides he wore a long doublebreasted coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles 
with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead he had a pinkishwhite complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and tightly curled paot 
the girls in the market place wore longsleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road 
rachel had seen me watching the young man  when your mother was here he must have been a young boy 
i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel she led me into a twisting side alley 
rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings we entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor 
he nodded clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were barearmed but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor 
little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and in the center of the room sat the teacher his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat 
he turned his surly halfclosed eyes toward us stared for a second then shouted in yiddish one two three the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses which they had previously chanted in hebrew 
each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and greatgrandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces 
since they did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty for distraction the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew rapping the stick incessantly 
his tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap 
my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago 
the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair 
i shuddered and backed out of the room rachel followed looked at me and clucked with her tongue 
i said how long do they keep that up  except for shabbat when they are praying all day 
the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish 
i reached into the pocket of my skirt fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man 
when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass they said that we must not fight but wait for the messiah 
you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal you had to know also that you were going to fail 
she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around she wished to change much for the children here 
but when she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim she was a strange woman your mother 
nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted for many immigrants for many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother 
and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people it was an impulse when she was here in mea shearim i was with her that led her to stay in israel 
here they did not need to be in ghettos if she could not take the children out of this section at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms 
i said quietly gaining nerve ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to be rebuffed then why did she leave israel id like to know that very much 
the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me 
but she had to go out and hurt herself he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted 
at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it was not so this refugee was a middleaged man a big handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen 
often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe 
your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she would send him home to his son he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him 
a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed she ran from a little group of us 
then she continued with energy i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father no one saw her except the man reuveni 
she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee he complained to me once that i must talk to her 
i asked her if she would and she said she would not he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him 
and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldnt understand why she had upset herself 
he would never let her harm herself again for one whole week he never let her stay alone 
reuveni took her with him wherever he went he did not let her talk to people 
she was limp and beaten from her loss  and ill take you with me 
 did i see him about to swing low in a chariot or maybe poling up the south fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it 
and the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along 
just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen or you could hope the parachute wouldnt open just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any harm to starkey poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice i think im pregnant 
and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you wont tell a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that is being an old maid too it is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull 
he can even be a mildvoiced littletown guy with bigtown ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldnt figure out how it is unlocked and he can be on the way to memphis your gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him really want him dead 
for you dont share him not even with god even if thats all the promise he ever gave or ever will give the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie 
and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants you or not you go with him in your heart you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could love him the way you do the one who got him because she didnt particularly give a damn whether she got him or didnt 
you think did he feel that way about me it comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldnt have gratt shafer 
it dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafers substitute that other guy and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big unhappy success 
you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldnt be happy yourself to give somebody else the one they wanted to give them you  damn the world she thought 
homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments the bands were impatient but they were the only ones 
it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day 
if a man was good if he was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too 
you laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm he hit the theme about dying to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without a second thought 
she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in august yes with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts of gratt shafer would not leave her  i should have stayed at the store she thought 
there was no lock because herman didnt allow a lock a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping 
she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the pipe connections from the wall the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching whicheverthehell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot 
among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs each of us had his own specialty besides 
he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or esquire i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver 
i remember once i did a jacket for magpie press the book was a fine historical novel about edward # and i did a week of research to get the details just right the fifteenthcentury armor furnishings clothes 
mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch and said nothing doing rufus in the first place its static 
and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place youve got six colors there including gold i said mr mckenzie it is as authentic as careful research can make it 
they know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards and girls couldnt have dressed like that it isnt transparent enough 
as for donald he actually sold paintings we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it 
he had style a real inner vision of his very own it was strange stuff it reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults 
we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted it may have been true for all i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles but it didnt prevent the paintings from being exciting 
he would look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said for christs sake donald youve got prussian blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well mrs monmouth thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting 
we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another attending the life class was my idea or rather askingtons idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldnt have gone if i hadnt talked them into it 
it wasnt just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used even to myself it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting 
askington was a kind of goal i set myself i had admired him long before i talked to him 
the night we first met at one of mrs monmouths giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade 
he was fifteen years older than i fortyfour but full of spring and sparkle he didnt look like what i thought of as an old man and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger 
you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month life had included him in its modern american artists series and had photographed him at his studio in the east sixties 
we went into mrs monmouths library which had low bookshelves all along the walls and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb the fireplace had tiles made for mrs monmouth by picasso himself 
in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying  no i take classes with different people he said 
besides its important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as durer went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna he made a circle with his thumb and fingers 
it doesnt embrace only the artist alone before his easel it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous 
 the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic no he is more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic one of these days im going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything thats being painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then youll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other 
ah what a title for the exhibition the eye is all just listening to him made me feel intelligent 
he teaches at the manhattan school of art i had studied with burns ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me along with the fivehundreddollar prize for my paintings of bums on hudson street 
 im also studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton  my god is he still alive 
still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvases of mountains and farms he even makes the city look like one of thoreaus hangouts 
 yes it sounds great i said but suppose you dont think of yourself as an impressionist painter  youre missing the point he said 
they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life thats one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation 
he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses 
we hold safe little jobs illustrating toothpaste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity what we need is to get back to the group to learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school 
it was an awkward hour but i didnt have to punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job after a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldnt feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the brushoff reading out to work 
 stimulating was the word for it i dont know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it to be 
i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars actually there was a lot of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week 
 ida where is the car license  i cant find it in the glove compartment 
 why should via have it had she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children 
 im sure shed turn it over to you if youd rather she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud 
walter was giving me checks for my pay the household bills had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind 
 i knew all this but i paid no attention i dont even own the house im standing in 
 it narrows down down down and finally there is no way out if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing 
i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself and in the same sequence i love you i think youre the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living i made a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend 
 i have these appointments in town for saturday and ill probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters at last i thought shes recovering her spirits 
i felt more cheerful as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life 
in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for town 
why when i drove down to church didnt it speak to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove absent itself unsee 
even at a cars length i could sense that something was wrong and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us 
the search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps everything was as i had left it the night before last her portfolio and bag for town her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out only her mink coat was missing 
it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via everybody and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me 
sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign to me  if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing 
and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the boat people liked me for myself i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage just to check 
i assumed it was one of those hourlong conversations with dolly or constance she comfortable in bed but it seemed not from what they were saying 
hanging on and on past any mans patience some final stab of conclusion she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff 
sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff its so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic 
but i didnt really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else when a fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant that i still cannot account for 
that at last the vigilance the will gives way or what was it that before via sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out i knew shed do it 
at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry was that what had given way in me 
it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other at the time i was filled with selfpity at this separation but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry 
it is not their avoidance that rankles it is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk away that it hurts 
no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs salter to return to the country 
 why put such a high value on being top dog it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal and she has never come to see me since 
if she chose and in that final decision discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self felt at last the passion of a great moral decision if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of selfexamination her search into herself and its conclusions 
she was finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice at rest with my darling ellen the first mrs salter 
then via called to say they had decided to cremate her as they had ellen the thought leaped to my mind and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses i had ordered 
via was in the parking lot when i went outside together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey 
again i felt impelled to kneel and reached back and pulled via down something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing 
a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the lancaster arms  uhhu she said hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid 
 im not a man who has many close intimate friends carla he said wanting her to know all about him  oh id drink with newspaper people 
but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with pausing he waited for her to turn to ask a question 
 well what about you carla  did you make friends easily 
 i guess so she said taking a kleenex from her purse when she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror 
he asked trying to touch a part of her life alberto hadnt discussed so he could have something of her for himself 
 you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift for words he added trying to flatter her vanity  you must have been good at history at school 
 dont you know all about me by this time you know something more about me every day dont you 
why are you trying to worry me  im not trying to worry you 
at home he had been a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance 
he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation then grew afraid if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose his view of her too 
 are those the only shoes you have sam  whats the matter with them 
 sam no one around here wears such heavy soles  maybe i could he said surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him 
 and i dont know why you want to go on wearing that outfit she said making a face  whats the matter with it 
cant you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged  i dont mind at all he said delighted with her attention 
but it was a hopeful sign he told himself she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in parioli 
they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens she had some amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days 
and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been there with alberto he let her tell him all about the church 
when they got home at midnight she was tired out and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing 
it was a good thing that she clung to her religion he thought she might like to take him to st peters 
you could take me to st peters  come on youll be late 
why did he want her to go to church he wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security 
she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible as for himself he just didnt have the temperament for it 
then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now 
it was too bad he wasnt a catholic himself or a protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox communist 
it was the times he was sure all the ideologies changing from day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom 
a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the stairs would think they were going to a late mass it seemed to him that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla 
and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it sam  im not good at that kind of thing 
lets be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were joking  if you find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair 
he didnt know how she would behave with other people when they walked into the ferraro apartment the old lady bowing and smiling said softly 
her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things agnese smiling too said ello and then more slowly i am happy 
the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee acting only as interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal 
watching her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being bounced back and forth signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly asked sam about canada having a special interest 
for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar did many of sams countrymen live in boxcars in the bush 
regretfully sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars just the same the old woman said she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country 
a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black eyes sparkling it was said that he had had a vision 
agnese had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes 
yes the pope could die and quickly be made a saint no he was indeed a saint now 
there was a certain discontent among the cardinals the pope in the splendor of his great intellect had neglected them a little 
jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carlas eye 
devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or malta or ireland but carlas eyes were on agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness 
its like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy tone but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the womens lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself 
he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach in her dark scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding 
even he wanting her afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences in her metabolism more his breath caught and trembling he closed his eyes and stumbled off 
he cried out to her his back turned then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry 
elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small curious clusters early spring came from her bed from beside her halfdrunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices 
when at last she could suffer the insult no longer nor face the girls scorn she said in a voice overloud go back where you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame 
and it was not pile of clouds she meant but now with real anger at last something proud and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried i will not shriek at you 
and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her side  you bring only wickedness she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal 
 go take helsqiyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the woman said  they do not have to face battle 
they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs 
but she did not move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging a great bullhide whip  go back to your lodges 
he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some tripping over themselves in their flight and early spring seized the whip and said 
drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband but the old man turned on her jerking the whip from her hand 
keep him back if you must tell me what to do i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who leads her to sin 
i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote 
do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain he sank back sighing and was soon asleep again 
and shoving her against a spruce her back to him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face she said to him her father how was i begotten in pain or joy 
they all know your foolish name she stared at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark 
the sounds of an animal in rage and despair suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high quavering voice 
move from the line or i will settle the whip on you do you hear the anger of the whips whine 
he said let me take her blows for there are demons in me too then without knowing why she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry 
he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his own oblivion 
but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them 
it was they who held the future in their hands they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons 
walitzee was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing and a very young one swan necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly 
he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices all the young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing 
at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they were in their regalia then again they would stand in circles making other preparations 
walitzee whitened his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue 
and the suspicious envenomed eyes of pile of clouds and those of early spring haunted and now full of hurt and envy 
he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance 
and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young mens blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills 
the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge 
they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousandlegged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated their grotesque cry of war she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white birch and maples 
she had never been here at this hour she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm 
and she walked easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her if i ever committed suicide she thought i would dive straight down from here and no one would find me for days 
she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her shortcut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward the reedy music of the frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was vibrant 
only only her thoughts were a little strange perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had no business to be here now 
 hello julie how are you and then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lowercut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him 
i wish i were older or younger julia bentley thought george rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night millie in a white robe standing like a ghost at the threshold 
it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning 
below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner they had left both of his eyes uncovered 
he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them 
he shivered and then tore away the bloodsoaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf sam would be amazed to find him gone 
he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness alex poldowski in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman 
perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs 
this was some freak two strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones the surface however was perfectly white 
hed have to think but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away 
the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below for a moment he felt like a thief discovered 
you shouldnt be up should you  i i was just leaving here julie 
she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern  well at least you wont have to do that she was saying 
but have you told mother you were going i just dont want anyone disturbed julie 
her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight  well wont you come in then have a cup of coffee or something 
he tried to see her face more clearly  no nothing at all he said after a moments hesitation 
he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids  as a great favor julie he said please dont mention youve seen me 
 all right she was staring at him he could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages 
i wouldnt have the strength to answer he thought he saw the suitcase which julia was holding 
he could hardly believe he was getting in pietro was gazing at him in an insolent disdainful fashion 
to the manner born odd to have such a thought at a time like this he had never felt particularly close to her 
 i wish i didnt have to go back to school she said and then i wish you lived in new york  i wish i did he responded 
 forget we ever knew what  oh just sort of everything in general 
 i know you feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say im supposed to joke about things arent i 
he could see the stone building where he lived  are you positive youll be all right by yourself 
he should have discovered a more tender farewell someone shouted at him well 
he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it in the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp 
tell sam not to worry about the car no please no visit today ill be asleep 
 joan did i wake you  yes i thought youd probably be up 
unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldnt quite put it that way to the boss oh hell no im not in a hospital 
but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinchhit for me hell understand you might give him sort of a tactful nudge 
no darling id rather you didnt come out a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape 
a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed 
she was a clever girl a most efficient secretary she let him come and go as he pleased or as it pleased her 
yet if he said make an excuse yourself come out here today she would have been on the next train and similarly if she had been in need he would have gone to her  they make us conformists look good 
it wasnt just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers of course it was jims little sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway myra 
 come come jim said jollying lucy a little upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room 
she always packed for a lifetime just in case every doll in the house must be going with her 
as he looked at her it registered anxiety  myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy 
jim had put the thanks in his sisters mouth  darling she said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend 
remember what happened the last time leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit 
lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if gregg myras husband hadnt gone out to fetch her  that was an awfully long two weeks 
 but she promised this will be different he said at last  youve got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there shell get a home for herself and cathy in no time 
lucy had an idea that myra loved it and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down 
remembering that succession of disasters she now considered cathy an ominous childcloud on her horizon the youngster drew her troubled her depths 
but cathy was myras responsibility not hers  i wouldnt even be surprised she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever 
lucy knew her too well to find it impossible  thats a horrible thing to accuse her of 
he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely susan  dont yell at susan lucy said 
their arms around each other they had been talking of the present and the future their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in light as the air around them 
myra with her news was on the other end of the line jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her 
 there isnt a chance of myras letting anything like that happen but they werent just friends lucy thought 
the only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister of his  well at last she said because susan was clattering down the stairs 
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls  do you need that big bundle 
susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief to her each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart 
 your father didnt mean it susan she gave jim a quick shapeup look of warning 
jim groaned but he lifted susans suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure the entire thousand and when you get back from grandmas cathy will be here to play with you 
and at this point lucy thought there should be a lecture on little cousins sharing dolls but she could sympathize with susan there ought to be a limit to sharing too 
the last one had been a lilliputian war she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had 
when the car with susans hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust the day was brilliant around her flowerscented crisp with breeze yet her inner turmoil darkened it 
she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their life together had she done that she turned and began to walk toward the house 
its mate must be at home silently guarding their nest she had better stay there lucy thought 
she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds she had a day of things to do 
she wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness as long as the unscrupulous myra chose 
it isnt only birds that dump their children in other peoples nests in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready guest room 
a row of little hangers waited for a childs clothes in the neatly empty closet since myra had always put most of gregs money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed 
many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her out in the hall the upstairs phone shrilled and the small ghost vanished 
 websterville junction calling she said  i just thought id let you know 
id have phoned sooner but ive been busy for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded by her multitude of dolls 
she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her you could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic 
on her way to the airport on her way to paris you bet lucy said to herself  ive been fixing up the guest room for cathy 
 just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them  well this time there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life 
she was not usually given to mysterious silences was she thinking along the same lines lucy was that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good 
once the soft pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted suddenly seekingly lucy asked mother do you know something i dont know 
just before myra left she was saying goodby to cathy and she didnt realize i was near she hesitated as though hunting over words and ways of putting them 
then she jumped to her feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake  then it was no bogey she had dreamed up 
for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her and when she found her voice anger thickened it then if myra does nothing about fetching her ill pack her right back to her mother if i have to take her myself 
for lucy the days nagging toandfro had come to an abrupt end as she hung up she saw through the halls open window the purpleblack flying of the cowbirds wings and heard their grotesque singing 
cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the path she trudged along slowly both hands clutching a tired teddy bear 
unlike susan she was traveling light the worn teddy bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were all she had 
they would have to buy things for her unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand 
the swirling sand made quints limp more pronounced they walked slowly past the sherbetcolored cottages eleven lemon nine mint seven orange around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats sign jiggling in the wind 
his rock was to the right of a vshaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here 
here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe he was a knight of the round table sir quintus the brave slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses 
 he was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature he was six feet one like his father with big hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to 
a dark bathroom can be pretty scary and hed creep back to bed proud of himself thinking tomorrow for sure ill go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left on a business trip to south america 
and when he woke up his father was saying stop screaming quint he could remember the feel of his fathers big hands the thump of his fathers heart sending out signals regular like radar 
look i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck dr fortman says swimming would help your leg 
in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out when you get back ill probly be swimming better than victoria 
she called him stuckup thats why nobody plays with you mister stuckup or what was worse she prayed for him out loud at bedtime please lord gord please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised 
he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks 
 aw shut up he said he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy surrounded by the ocean 
and shivering with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water  watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back 
she wore a bathing suit like his mothers no straps on the shouders  ever hear of squatters rights 
 mister big britches arent you  then why dont you stop squinting 
 you shouldnt smoke so much he said unconsciously imitating victorias holierthanthou voice not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum 
 if i was your mama id wop your tail off she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace 
 why dont you paint it red and white like a barber pole  because maybe i wont have to wear it always 
she spouted a mouthful of water into the air someones walking past you want to stop him zoooop snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane 
hey will you look at that maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail 
 holy mackerel thats the most unique dog i ever saw she said firmly  his real names dimaggio only we call him maggie because he has to take tranquilizers 
he would have told her but victoria was yodeling come home or ill come find you 
they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter same time early before the fog burned off because she didnt like the sun 
 you going to marry the king hes got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork 
 name one i been there japan she said smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks 
near galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night as for dancing holy mackerel he ought to see the gypsies in jerez 
she made better pictures than any book hed read but he didnt say so artfully as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war 
that he personally had an iq of ### and was currently reading the mushr to ozon volume of the encyclopedia she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed a funny hoarse laugh he liked to hear 
 what did one tonsil say to the other tonsil lets get dressed up the doctors taking us out tonight 
 encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries cooling on the porch 
 say youre quite a comic sabella said admiringly  ever thought about going on the stage 
 better make up your mind son sabella said  you cant serve cod and salmon 
next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the vshaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough 
he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered dont feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared 
as for his promise oh he had plenty of time buckets of time  we beseech thee lord gord to bless this food that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib 
 your daddys in san francisco she told them  he says hell be here on the oneoclock plane 
a cave seemed to be opening in quints stomach  children well have to get organized 
 hurry up were late he said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and koolaid green it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung 
when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly with it driving back from an afternoons golf at oakmont it seemed to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of the community linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone held his or her breath 
hadnt linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years wasnt john cooper even more attractive at fortyseven than he had been twentyfive years earlier 
didnt john cooper after all this time deserve something better of life wasnt it adult and realistic to look at it that way 
it was the kind of thing that could ruin a mans life and it was a tribute to johns strength of character and very real business ability that it hadnt ruined his  of course there was nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen mousie chandler said to linda stuart 
for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggleeyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes 
johnandlinda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours then there was a spat over something as there had been lovers spats before 
first it came out after mr coopers will was settled he had died the year before that john and his mother werent rich any more and then there was lindas engagement to bobbie evans 
he was a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same steel company as john did some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no longer be johnandlinda even to sentimental wishful thinkers 
mousie chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at hornes  well you shouldnt underestimate edythe mousie said 
she is frivolous and scatterbrained but she really isnt shallow bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding 
 as if he were choking she said edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example 
she didnt have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart and you didnt see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted away from the gang 
others thought he couldnt stand seeing linda mrs bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything johns mother died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money left 
he was not reduced to poverty but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day it probably wasnt hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to 
but the continuing charm of the other children sally in #### and jack in #### and all johns success at his work only made edythes dizziness and general uselessness more glaring she never could fit into a crowd which had known which still knew and admired linda 
she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr webber the eldest elder whod never donated more than five dollars to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what edythe called the bosoms of the church john did find the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually oversubscribed which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries 
poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one he was an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they knew that money must be a problem to him 
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than was necessary 
he and linda settled down to being social leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda mourning alone and lovely 
 now you know she couldve but she isnt that kind of girl but now well it would be a blessing i think 
what she felt was a bonedeep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death it was what she had been thinking herself 
there was no one who would blame her or john it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere 
it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of linda would have to wait she knew 
years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at smith & macisaacs where john and bobbie both worked 
so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with carnegieillinois it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie for linda knew how to help her husband not just the stuartfamily contacts but also the little dinners for reuben lovejoy 
 you must have done something something wrong lord knows i had everything set for you 
they had their first real fight and bobbie went off to get drunk linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened 
but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldnt understand he didnt tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other 
 i think were agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive  now i believe poor johnll work just a little harder 
bobbie with linda behind him will have plenty of other opportunities and also the money cant mean as much to bobbie 
poor john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too 
the job at funk wasnt particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of lindas family when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future 
 shirley appreciated the chance to make some money such a nice little thing lives right in the building 
i could get along without that three dollars in some ways it was worth being out the money just knowing i was no longer obligated to nadine 
i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour i answered to find nadine at the other end 
 janice nobody answers at the apartment that stupid girl might have gone off and left francie 
 shes probably fallen asleep and doesnt hear the phone but if youre worried you can go home and check 
old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply cant afford to get ken mad at us i was all set for what came next 
ill call you there in ten minutes  i cant make it in ten minutes wondering as i said it why i should make it at all 
so sure that money could do anything not for the dollar or so nadine would give me 
chris was sound asleep and i didnt see any sense in waking him i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened 
 its all right i said as she started to look scared  mrs roberts had called and couldnt wake you 
 im hard to wake up she faltered and nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable 
 i didnt know it was going to be this late  thats mrs roberts again i said 
i told nadine everything was fine and that id be getting on home  janice would you mind staying 
 wallys drunk ill get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i dont want shirley to see him like this you know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building 
she didnt even give me a chance to refuse well there wasnt any law that said i had to stay 
so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she scooted off to her own apartment after i looked in at francie i went into the living room and waited 
nadines shrill with anger wallys loud and thick as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two i opened the door and wally stumbled in fast as if nadine had pushed him 
her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead  pack your clothes she hissed 
 youre crazy wally said thickly he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it and was instantly asleep 
i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and she was crazy  you stay out of this she spat at me 
 he told ken to his face that he doesnt have what it takes to get a woman and the other people there were listening 
 youd better simmer down i said nervously in the state she was in she could actually kill him 
 how can you be so damn stupid ken will never forgive him never 
all we own is francies bedroom set and the televisonrecord player and we even owe on them and well be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours and all because of that 
wally cant go any place at this hour  well then ill get out but she looked uncertain 
 you go to bed i said curtly  in the morning you and wally can talk things out 
i got her into bed and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out it was three oclock before i figured it was all right to go 
i had done all i was going to do whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine 
i snuggled up close to him loving him thankful for a man like him in the afternoon nadine and wally came over with francie 
 id had all this trouble with the old man thats why i drank so much i got fired yesterday for not attending to business 
seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side mr thom had gotten wally on the phone and fired him 
 but ken got coy and wouldnt make any promises and i was plastered and i blew my stack 
i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there but she was beyond caring what she said 
but i couldnt help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved now maybe theyd realize that life can be tough 
they had not only spent every cent they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything they owned on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written notice that he was fired they were evicted 
he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded  i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over 
it was easy enough to say it because of course we couldnt spare a cent  im glad you feel that way honey 
we can let them move in with us it was incredible he gave me an embarrassed pleading look 
straightened out theyd had years of making all that money  i wont do it i said flatly 
well now she can sleep in the street for all i care  that isnt like you janice chris said uncomfortably 
but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us but in the end we did 
the finance company took all their furniture and they didnt have a cent to their name to my way of thinking he was scared sick 
chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special at least well eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away 
when she wasnt crying she was in our bedroom fighting with wally  virus infection nothing shed scream at him 
but it couldnt go on forever a couple of weeks chris had said i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks 
nadines constant nagging had finally gotten wally out of bed he set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of alibis and excuses 
 you can get a job working in a grocery store if nothing else  the high school kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice 
 by fall theyll be back in school id say trying to sound encouraging but this was only the middle of july 
i mentioned it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a bad day 
part of it was being so tired id not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well that kept me up late but the rest of it the main part wasnt based on logic at all 
for the thousandth time i wished id chosen some nice ninetofive fivedaysaweek profession and for the thousandth time i answered myself 
actually i shouldnt complain i told myself in the shaving mirror i had a lot to be thankful for 
maybe i didnt see as much of gladdy as id like but how much worse it would have been if id had to board her out somewhere after alice went send my daughter to an orphanage or a boardinghome at least we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after us no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was 
especially in the way gladdy had turned out growing up without a mother from the time she was three it wasnt a good thing for a child even knowing the kind of mother alice had been 
if shed kept on as shed been going the story id told gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhowas usual gladdys bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table 
it made me feel good and knowing that shed decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too oh i knew that i couldnt give myself all the credit for her decision 
shed been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little but once i was alone again driving to the hospital the heaviness returned 
should i tell him the truth about alice did he have a right to know the secret id kept from gladdy all these years 
two interns and dick ishii the other resident im chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds 
there wasnt anything of special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven hed had a case of postoperative shock but it was all taken care of now 
when wed finished our regular rounds pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor  got a new one in last night he said 
the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics we didnt get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights 
the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed theyd cleaned her up some of course and shed pretty much slept off her drunk 
alice but this womans name was rose bancroft yes rose bancroft diagnosis acute alcoholism 
an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the telltale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry her coarse hair was twocolored bleached blonde and its real dirty gray 
in a low voice dick filled us inshed been picked up downtown passed out in the doorway 
wed keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her but if she wasnt interested shed just go back to the same life shed left 
i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak  now miss or is it mrs bancroft 
this was one time id have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong but those penetrating eyes i had to turn my head away 
 i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly no emotion in her voice  have you spoken to a doctor about it 
i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table  better do a papanicolaou i told pete 
pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab with a request for the test that done i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind 
late in the afternoon i was up on seven again one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled 
 ive got the results on the bancroft smear test he said do you want to talk to her doctor 
well do a d and c and get her permission for a hysterectomy maybe its nothing maybe its intraepithelial or in situ cant take any chances 
 groggins tells me shes started badgering already wants to get out wants to get to her booze i guess 
wed been standing right outside miss bancrofts door and as i went to turn the knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar but she seemed to be dozing and in any case wed been talking in low tones 
 i sure cant complain about the service in this place she said  i just got through seeing one of you guys 
 ive just been talking to dr michelson i said  wed like you to have a dilatation and curettage 
but we would like your permission to do that is to go further if it proves necessary actually i rather doubt that well have to do this 
i was sure that was the difficulty she just didnt want to stay here where she couldnt get to the liquor id had patients whod refused surgery before of course but never one who didnt show in one way or another the reason why 
 will you tell me why  you shouldnt tell your little secrets outside of the patients door she said 
 im not going to be one of your guinea pigs let your pupils learn on someone else doctor 
even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone this was someone whod come down in the world i thought 
 you havent got cancer i said as strongly as i could  i dont know what you heard that would make you think so but i assure you i dont even know myself so how can you be so sure 
she could have found out my first name of course that wouldnt be difficult but there was that something some echo in the way she spoke 
but you havent changed much joe i knew then knew with a heartstopping shock 
 whats the matter joe you scared of me think im going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife 
 where have you been all these years as for coming back here well ill tell you the truth i didnt even know where i was when i came to 
the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout made me shudder  i never asked you for any favors joe she went on but im asking one now 
no i want out joe i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me 
what shed said was true in all these years shed never asked for anything from me if i let her go shed disappear once more 
her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any womans the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic 
i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under ### feet getting drunker happier and more contented by the second the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now 
perhaps if i took off the aqualung i could swim better love my woman better i chuckled aloud and the mouthpiece fell out 
it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris it was no vacation just me getting out after a bellyfull 
once before i had been to paris long before i married valery that first time was good and it stuck with me 
it was a saturday evening in april with a mistlike rain and i was a little high on the good taste of life i had a pocketful of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane would be grounded all night 
all the women were beautiful and the men were equal to them there were some sweet machines other than women an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow a type a##ajk mercedes and lots more 
i had champagne at maxims then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing it down with red wine 
she was blonde and young and nice and round in a tight white dress maybe her ravenous eating wasnt grotesque because she was so positive about it 
 handsome soldier i have assuaged one hunger with food  madame i said with noblesse oblige because of the handsome yeah 
she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl toward the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese 
i made the mistake of going to the jour et nuit the place was busy but i didnt feel like a hun 
i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils so help me then switched to tuborg after a few hours life hadnt showed and i was crocked 
all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space i read the tropic of capricorn and the tropic of cancer 
i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others 
sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky 
i had on only a topcoat but i wasnt cold pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick 
suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella without it she would have been drab and limp 
she was another human being and happened to be a hustler i didnt much care if she were there or not 
hardly glancing at her i smiled a bleak one which said thanks baby but id rather be alone she was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy 
she was trying to make a hole in my armor and i didnt want it she must have seen the ring on my left hand 
 ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it this took me so funny i had to look at her 
she smiled at me but it was an awfully sad smile her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them 
because i liked this sad person so much i said will you have a drink with me i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit 
 im sorry i havent got a glass i said  non non she said taking the bottle not for that be sorry 
its really rotten to drink good cognac like that but i hadnt cared before i wasnt going to lug around a glass 
no child this tart she must have been thirtyfive or even forty not good looking but selfconfident and wise so that it made her attractive 
we finished the bottle i hadnt had a lot out of it earlier not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober i suppose we were cold but we didnt feel it 
then she said allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery 
she had a funny little scar on her stomach on the left side i think we were very tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime had melted 
i was hungry as a wolf and my body felt lean and vital  bon jour i said brightly sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips 
with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her 
i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast  the toothbrush monsieur he said presenting it 
i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away 
we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot hardboiled eggs and hot garlic bread her name was suzanne and mine stephen 
 you are very tactful do you know stephen she remarked  yes because you didnt run off to use that new toothbrush 
 i didnt really use yours she went on i know men never kiss les putains 
she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and drained her own i asked touching the scar on her stomach 
the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all she understood sex anyway and played at it well 
it was a nice place not filled with smoke the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered 
i fixed him with a steely eye and said whats this for i didnt ask for a jeroboam of champagne 
two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield she put them in her bag she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street 
an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead in her minds eye her imagination responding fully almost exhaustingly to these shores peculiar powers of stimulation she saw the city as from above telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress there a pine and all around the low blue hills 
she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight moreover nursing various stubblefields her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy illnesses everybody could tell you the stubblefields were always sick theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot 
the very night after her fathers funeral she had thought though never admitted to a soul now i can go so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy 
cars taxis buses and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain shoals of tourists went by her in national groups english school girls in blue uniforms german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows 
something special was going on here just now the annual display of azalea plants she had heard about it the night before at her hotel 
the azaleas were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink along with many white ones too marvelous thought theresa climbing in her portly wellbred way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything 
halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass or just enjoying the sun 
the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette 
presently she picked up the first of the letters a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay 
poor cousin elec she thought tears rising to sting in the sun but why couldnt he have arranged to live through the summer and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway 
her cousin emma carraway had written it in her loose high old ladys script ts carefully crossed but ls inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her nextdoor neighbor 
 across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway 
two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a motherofpearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died im supposed to care as much now as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh 
she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george but alas george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elecs funeral 
his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he had one so far still in diapers he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand 
theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george could it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull 
there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool 
they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan  can you think of anything to do 
can you think of anything to do  you might treat it like the hiccups said papa 
 i just hope this happens to you someday said cousin elec who was not at his best  poor cousin elec george said 
now here they both were still the same george full of roundeyed woe and cousin emma in despair  of course georges letter continued there are practical problems to be considered 
robbie and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have told her shes more than welcome here but i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long as our rosie is still in high school the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with miss edna whittaker for example 
a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off 
 i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best 
ill start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps she got up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men 
yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal portraits 
carrozza rides in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two 
the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation she cast about as though looking for a policeman this really shouldnt be allowed 
theresa stubblefield still holding the family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between cousin elecs death and doing something about cousin emma they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries and come home in august to get cousin emmas house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september 
the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow 
it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twentysix volumes of elsie dinsmore she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other 
she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display  mi diapiace signora ma insomma 
i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield that lucille was a husband stealer you cant keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only ####plus 
just as it has its susan dolan though nobodyd ever bothered to tell me that they even talked about lucille down at the young christians league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission 
they were goodliving religious people and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldnt have dreamed of saying it in front of me 
and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs warren i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck 
 look sue baby hed said much as i love you well a guys a guy and lucilles willing to to come across 
i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren my love for johnnie was young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didnt hesitate to use her sex 
it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered i wasnt in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was different 
he had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids dont have but that i had sometimes admired in other older men his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp 
i could hardly believe such good luck was mine and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him 
a man had to have his release at least thats what the boys used to say in high school and i wasnt providing it for johnnie she wouldnt have even if hed asked her 
and he wouldnt leave her either hed told me that he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy 
it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time against my folks wishes wed been seeing each other for short rides in the truck 
but by the time the first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly in love yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little 
 i always imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that  and you fall for a lumber jockey 
 i could walk out the door  and never show my face or my truck around here again 
i huddled miserably beside him in the truck it was all my doing his seeing her 
at first johnnie hadnt understood how could he not being a religious person like me but then he had said all right kid if thats how you want it thats how itll be 
i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil 
i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches of lucille warren and though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever triggered 
astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness begging this man to make love to me outside in the summertime fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us 
and i snuggled closer to the man i loved it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced 
 it cant be wrong can it its never wrong if love is real 
i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about 
i was practically a bride after all there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible 
hed not only told me so hed proved it it wasnt johnnies fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable 
and if i could contribute to that id do it no price is too high when true love is at stake 
id never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half 
it wasnt i was sure a difference in age that came between people but a difference in maturity and hadnt i rescued him from lucille warren 
after all lucille warren was a husbandstealer from way back but id been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared 
 always and always johnnie a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow 
id been seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didnt want to leave him for five whole days but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group 
i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group the first meeting was held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states 
one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing blue eyes he looked very different from johnnie in fact he looked sort of like me 
after the meeting there was going to be a party at someones house i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated 
 hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald said  need a pumpkin to get to the party 
by the time we arrived the party was already going strong a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized they were drinking 
i hadnt liked it at first it was bitter and burning but when johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it 
johnnie i suddenly realized hed been totally out of my thoughts all evening but that was only natural i decided 
 i dont see alma anywhere i said cmon lets find out where theyre keeping the glasses 
but at least come along while i get lubricated strange faces most of them and i wasnt even sure all of them had come from the league meeting 
today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better 
 you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting rain that had sounded reasonable in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic arrangement 
she had explained it something about summer peoples eating out and not enough space in the units he remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelortype eatables 
it was still raining and mrs kirbys cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day 
 take a full month the doctor had said  lots of sun lots of rest 
you young men get to be my age you wont take flu so lightly the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi 
he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride goodby forever which was really piling it on he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women 
from now on his was going to be a mans world the north woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries meanwhile he had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctors prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery 
he looked up to see mrs kirby awesome in a blackandyellow polkadotted slicker bearing down on him he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists 
 i hope so he said thought id bake it out in the sun 
charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less than weatherproof as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian lost to him forever 
all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age if he lived that long he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins at the seashore at the mountains on the farm and in danger and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoofandmouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated 
he took a yellow pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something alive in the refrigerator something pink and fuzzy his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in 
he thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind next morning he found a note in the refrigerator 
everything being the sweater a lipstick case and a squirt bottle of kissin kare pink hand lotion the note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine 
he scrawled sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added dont you eat he didnt want to encourage anything here 
 not onions came the answer the following day must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fastfrozen 
now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink they would be black or white or horseblanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself 
 why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails 
i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur he could hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn 
clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins had done him no good the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirbys varicolored properties 
this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door he could not imagine a flowers being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and the rest 
no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes he got a red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest on the wrapping 
the note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript youre not at all well are you  ive got this cold he wrote 
 its none of my business said the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninetysix i mean shes still living and shes ninetysix 
by the next morning she had turned the paper over he stuck his head in mrs kirbys little rental office 
i havent seen her on the beach  you wont if youre looking for a redhead 
there were pink bathing suits on blondes and brownyhaired girls in red or black or green bathing suits there were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits 
he paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white one of those bulky turtleneck sweaters on the beach there were pale girls and notsopale girls 
at two that morning he was still walking up and down peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note 
 of course i dont mind she answered  youre having a miserable time arent you 
this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided sympathy is a fine quality in a woman 
she felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own 
charlie couldnt see vivian offering any hand lotion she might peel him once the worst of the agony was over 
the only thing this lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if youre so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it  im not that anxious but maybe thats why youre so fair 
do you have anything to read while youre shut up there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness and a book called tom swift and his speedy canoe 
there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop 
then in the fifth annistons kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field eddie lee riversides redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled past him 
eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil phil spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegans hands on third base 
but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late he came into the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in his face 
mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher this brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar 
when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water fountain for a drink 
he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began  keep your eyes open sonny 
this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said ill get that little bastard so help me god ill get him 
 mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble 
in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielders head by the time the fielder got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home 
but mike had no chance of being tagged all deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into the catcher 
the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer 
mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching when the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said that ought to teach the sonofabitch 
the anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout he was followed by four of his men 
mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer eddie lee moved over to mike deegans side 
 deegan the manager said his voice pitched low quivering  that was a rotten thing to do 
tell your guys not to block the plate  you didnt have to ram him 
he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for anniston the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat 
the first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for mikes head deegan fell into the dirt the ball going over him 
in the riverside dugout frankie ricco shortstop whispered into phils ear theres gonna be a fight mike was slow getting into the box this time 
 one more and im coming out there mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat 
the pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for mikes head deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound 
they were both walking towards each other unhurried riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field 
mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started 
 its a helluva thing mike said looking at phil when a guys own teammate wont come out and help him in a fight phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head 
mike went over to phil and stood over him  why the hell didnt you come out when you saw them gang up on me 
mike placed both his hands on his hips  listen wise guy if you think im gonna do all the fighting for this ball club youre crazy 
 i didnt ask you to fight for the ball club phil said slowly  you trying to say i started the fight 
phil turned away and opened his locker and then he heard mike deegan say youre yellow rossoff and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around 
 phil come into my office eddie said phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door 
 you get your unconditional release as of today  the best thing for you to do eddie said is go home 
 but it does confirm what ive suspected all along  sit down sit down eddie said 
you havent got the heart for baseball  what the hell do you think baseball is 
phil started to say something but eddie cut him short  now dont tell me what a good ball player you are 
you just havent got the heart for proball and thats it dazed phil said i dont get it 
 what difference does your batting average make i tell you when its necessary to hurt in order to win you wont do it 
deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission thats one less who might take his job away later on 
its a way of life goddamit and youve got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you 
youll get your pay in the morning phil turned and left the room hearing eddie say someday youll see i was right 
phil said i got my release  i dont know phil said 
phil started to take his clothes off and frankie sat down on the bench again phil took off one shoe and stared at it 
 hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later the leagues are full of guys like that 
 why not try another club what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that 
he just didnt know what he was talking about saying a thing like that  will you do it phil 
 im not worried about it phil said what else did eddie have to say 
his broad reading took him into certain byways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him when he was twelve he took to reading st augustine and aquinas then laotse confucius mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous socioarchaeological papers 
and one day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to read 
 did you think there were two  you dont understand richard said gloomily 
richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didnt speak to his parents about religion again his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs 
richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore literature life politics and history he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country 
she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested  do you still have the book of the dead 
 yes he lied to shorten the conversation i still have it he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject 
he had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open the big furnace given them up to the flames then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried 
during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water 
it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend 
he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo in charlotte richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which after a fashion he envied 
she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small teadrinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations at one such gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today 
 well its at fudomae and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in the pool richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but charlottes manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it 
soba udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious 
 he wasnt the least bit disturbed by my watching him said charlotte  i shouldnt have been able to do that 
sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo  ive heard about it samuel burns said 
 yes a little parkish place charlotte said and concluded anyhow its all very nice and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo 
this is the interesting part richard she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking  there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold 
 and the water would be still colder ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it  and your golden god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath 
richards dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light fudo the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala 
he found himself trying to remember something but he couldnt decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching 
that night after leaving charlottes apartment richard walked about for a time before returning to his room when he at last did go to his room he couldnt sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala thinking first of charlottes tale of the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters 
he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool 
the strange creature housed in wire made him shudder the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountainfalls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach 
into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundredyen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze but the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest 
the black fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richards eyes were caught by the fudos in fascination and then richard was shocked as all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudos face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it then the flames were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently 
he walked all the miles back to his room he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot 
but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldnt rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day the cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life 
i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings it had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brothers son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground carrying the jar of cool water 
he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor sounds with his lips i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time 
it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly 
i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic that id had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful he was multicolored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly 
i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it 
i followed it looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a babys fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jetblack the colors were astonishing clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm 
his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth you beauty i said i couldnt kill you 
i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant firecolored body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make the body caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body 
the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target 
it shone in its bright diamond color against the sunburned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field 
i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake 
even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy i could see the hunchedup shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick 
i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering dance i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late 
i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on my head began to ache and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon crushed or they vanish 
he was eleven and we had done many things together he was a beautiful boy really with finelyspun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike and his eyes were blue 
he was my nephew my brothers son handsome and warm and newlyscrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brothers and mine as well i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something there where i had been not long before 
 can i ride around with you he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me 
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his  no you cannot i said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me 
 yes he said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement he tried to take my hand to show me 
didnt you see how beautiful it was  snakes are ugly he said again 
have you ever seen anything like it around here  snakes are ugly and bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died 
 they eat chickens sometimes the boy said  they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes 
 you killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason  theyre ugly and i hate them the boy insisted 
the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented with what he had done the fire of the colors was gone 
the beautifullytapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted torn mouth the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life 
i touched it and the coolness the icefeeling was gone and even then it moved a little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it and then it moved a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have to kill it there 
im sorry i thought to the snake for you were beautiful i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the wrenches from the toolkit and i struck its head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live 
 its a big snake isnt it  im going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed 
 dont you see the difference now  its an ugly terrible snake he said 
i could see the happiness in the boys eyes the gleeful brutality he looked up at me puzzled and he swayed his head from side to side 
i wanted to slap his face to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided then very suddenly what i would do cady didnt come unglued easily but this had not been a day of glad tidings 
hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago yes the boys credentials were in order scholastic transcript character references picture health record successful college boards 
cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort this was the letter which would or would not enroll his son david in hanford 
his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant or chief he wondered if he had played it wrong 
besides cady partlow knew he wasnt the oldgradtype look at pete alcorn who hadnt missed a hanford ball game in fifteen years 
cady looked at his own sons scholastic record with pride good solid b average with a sprinkling of as in math and science 
mr partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford but then he hadnt studied very hard 
he put down his pipe and started to type  in response to your letter i can in good conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership 
he didnt have to be told his son looked like him david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness 
 his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics tennis and swimming his chief motivation for enrolling at hanford is the desire to 
he paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build how do you tell a college president that your son doesnt know what he wants to do 
how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential that he will find himself just give him time give him a chance 
what a production to make of a letter commending your own son his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soulsearching panic 
he told hanford his son had participated in numerous highschool activities he belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club 
then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph next to davids he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket 
after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of partlow products half of it was natural half was smith college 
she said what she meant and let it be he could take the advice or leave it 
 you look like you just heard a real gasser mr partlow cady looked at tom who had taken him up and down for fifteen years 
when i went to college they begged you to come now you have to be well rounded firm in motivation and prepacked with knowledge 
my john applied to six colleges before he got in hes president of the rocket club here you know 
he got a science scholarship to yale  oh said mr partlow thats fine tom 
he hadnt told anyone but he too had applied to five colleges for david he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him 
nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose 
she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day  board meeting tonight cady 
 why not let him take it cady i know it is midweek but its only eight days before commencement 
carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly mr chairman cady partlows head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse 
 hear anything from hanford yet dad dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys 
anne said it wasnt surprising because charles was antisocial a lone wolf and completely onesided  i can hardly say the same about you dave 
anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable booklined room 
your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it hanford college hasnt decided on daves application yet 
cady handed her the letter drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence  i know you wrote this in a hurry but cady dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days 
 and he wasnt really elected treasurer of the science club he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball playoff 
no cady he made second team  a team is a team insisted cady 
he was mad about stars at the age of nine geology you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago 
he hasnt been to a symphony concert all season  but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts 
hes hes just there thats all he likes to play bass because he doesnt have to solo 
but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention chief crazy horse and his five colts anne laughed and cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck 
 but you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college he has to have leadership as well as grades 
he hasnt used it now for several years can you really say his motivation for college is electronics 
 and what would you say he wants to do  its dave who is applying to hanford college 
 i have talked to him but you know ive never tried to push him into any profession i wont be guilty of trying to run his life 
 just because your father tried to make a banker out of you youve leaned over backward to keep your hands off but subconsciously youve wanted him to conform to your mold 
cady put the wellworn chip back on his shoulder not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people 
you cant run a war with ninetynine generals and one private cady walked the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne 
and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life 
when he rose in the morning the image was still there he had always been a messy and negligent man 
no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug 
half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party 
her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair 
but to put it bluntly nothing snapped yet that had not seriously troubled him not then 
he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting 
but at the start his new life felt invigorating it was on the tenth day after the wedding how could it have been so soon 
 now im not going to pick up those shorts  i think youll get tired of them there 
he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests 
the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face 
i can be as stubborn as she can he thought shell rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings 
he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts 
with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there 
all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks clearly she had been instructed not to say a word 
in american romance almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called meeting cute that is boymeetsgirl seems more adorable if it doesnt take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom just about the most enthralling reallife example of meeting cute is the charles macarthurhelen hayes saga reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts but he said simultaneously i wish they were emeralds 
the way macarthur said his line if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on emeralds and wish note pitch # pretty high on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl one degree of oversoftness 
and the drawling oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture in other words like automation machines designed to work in tandem they shared the same programming a mutual understanding not only of english words but of the four stresses pitches and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white 
but consider if you can bear it what might have happened if macarthur for some perverse undaunted reason had made the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo to her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber 
this basic principle the first in a richly knotted bundle was conveyed to me by dr henry lee smith jr at the university of buffalo where he heads the worlds first department of anthropology and linguistics a brisk amusing man apparently constructed on an ingenious system of springjoints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind smith began his academic career teaching speech to barnard girls a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young rat named arthur who never could make up his mind 
it was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication to the trained ear of the linguist talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker such things as geographical origin and/or history socioeconomic identity education 
this for obvious reasons makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy smiths first workout with stresses pitches and junctures was based on mother which spells in our culture a good deal more than bread alone 
the usual us norm would be af middle pitches slight pause juncture before mother slight rise at the end the symbols of mothers status here are all usual for culture usa 
this is a fade ending and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech expressing something less than conventional respect for mother even less regard for mom and moms apple pie goes with af in other words the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated 
an accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp with this sevenword sentence though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food he was telling things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture 
since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of redstone proportions in new research and training some of the earliest recordings made in the ####s demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which if they were at all discernible in print were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts 
at a minimum recording usually on tape which is now in wide professional use brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists newest to this highpowered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level 
linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patients voice departs from expected norms it flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at all this last often marked by a fadein beginning of sentences 
his esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient in one nowhistoric first interview for example the transcript reproduced from the book the first five minutes goes like this the therapists level tone is bland and neutral he has for example avoided stressing you which would imply disapproval 
the patient on the other hand is far from neutral aside from her specifically regional accent she reveals by the use of the triad irritable tense depressed a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ie she must have had at least a highschool education and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before 
consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably not the true target of her resentment 
within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the womans husband she says later but still within the opening five minutes i keep thinking of a divorce but thats another emotional death 
so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce by saying another emotional death she reveals that there has been a previous one although she has not described it in words 
the phrase emotional death interesting and to a nonscientific mind rather touching suggests that this woman may have some flair for words perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called creative since the psychiatric interview like any other interview depends on communication it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience 
interestingly enough although none of the reallife therapists involved could conceivably compare with blauberman when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques almost everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again 
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen naturally the patient does not say i hate my father or sibling rivalry is what bugs me 
some of the classic indicators as described by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first five minutes are these ambiguity of pronouns stammering or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty 
the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives 
 this patient in actuality was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty  amateur linguists note here that pursewarden in durrells alexandria quartet stammered when he spoke of his wife which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship 
she was the john harvey one of those atlantic seahorses that had sailed to bari to bring beans bombs and bullets to the us fifteenth air force to field marshal montgomerys eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of #### the john harvey arrived in bari a port on the adriatic on november ##th making for porto nuovo which as the name indicates was the ancient citys new and modern harbor 
if anyone thought of the john harvey it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried it had required the approval of president franklin delano roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with ### tons of mustard gas and despatched to the italian warfront 
throughout the early years of world war # reports persisted that the axis powers had used gas germany in russia japan in china again influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns 
to silence extremists to warn the axis president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august  from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare 
 however evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources  use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind 
i state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies the following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern italy 
it would be made in three waves the first to lay down a smokescreen the second to drop the gas bombs the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below so the vile cargo went into the hole of the john harvey 
only a few other people very important people knew of the nitrogenmustard eggs nestled below decks thus in the immemorial way in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not was the stage set for tragedy at bari 
it was getting on toward # oclock and the german me### plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit capt a b jenks of the office of harbor defense was very worried 
on november ##th they had made a raid on la maddalena two days later some ## of them had struck at a convoy off bougie sinking a troopship and it had been that very night that the me### had made its first appearance 
 for three days now a german reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures theyre just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the adriatic 
even though it was known that the luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general peltz the commander who would conduct the little blitz on london in #### a major raid on bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously true there had been raids on naples but naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast 
so captain jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him for jenks knew that baris defenses were made of paper 
there were no raf fighter squadrons on bari airfield the radar station with the best location was still not serviceable 
it had been made shockingly evident that very morning to ensign kay k vesole in charge of the armed guard aboard the john bascom a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped 
 this harbor is a bombers paradise the britisher had said with frank grimness  its up to you to protect yourselves 
theyre all being used on offensive missions not fire until the bombs came down 
like hell hed wait and supposing the radarcontrolled gun got knocked out what would his guns guide on then the north star 
below decks seaman #/c stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home above decks on the john harvey lieutenant richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy 
bari was asking for it he thought for five days now they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold 
the burden of his secret was pressing down on him as it was on lieutenant beckstrom and his six enlisted men lieutenant richardson could envy the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs 
nine of them had gone down the gangplank already deck cadet james l cahill and seaman walter brooks had been the first to leave 
the other half of the crew plus beckstrom and his men had remained aboard damned if that wasnt a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor porto vecchio 
then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver and he glanced upward it was a clear night and it was raining 
captain musmannos renovated schooner with the flamboyant name unsinkable had just left porto vecchio with a cargo of badlyneeded olive oil for the sorrentines civilian population at exactly ### he felt a fluttering object brush his face 
it was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating another longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth 
unsinkable slowed and stopped hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek the antiaircraft guns coughed and chattered and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at bari they had come from airports in the balkans these hundredodd junkers ##s 
they had ruined the radar warning system with their window they had made themselves invisible above their flares and they also had the lights of the city the port wall lanterns and a shore cranes spotlight to guide on 
in that interval the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss 
they got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under ensign vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly but they had no targets 
vesole rushed from gun to gun attempting to direct fire norton and rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors 
luckily she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt the order to abandon ship was given but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks 
you explain i have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before i cant tell when but im positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past 
emerson in his lecture refers to the startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue already seen illusion just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences 
when a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance of deja vue except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar occasionally there are examples of prevision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude 
rudyard kiplings scorn for the jargon of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered how or why had i been shown an unreleased roll of my life film the famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself 
at that moment kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts 
as a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case and what is more every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams dreams present many mysteries of telepathy clairvoyance prevision and retrovision 
i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the bombing of a little korean town i am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that lifelike sequence so complete in detail from the hodgepodge of news pictures i have seen 
skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence the question becomes what is a dream 
every dream and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects 
for instance the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with photographic realism sees smith driving the car whereas it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car 
the entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support a mental image subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension 
as in the theory of perception established in psychophysiology the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain but then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain 
but why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain as retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location 
modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy we know that the number of radio and television impulses sound waves ultraviolet rays etc that may occupy the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite 
this theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions 
it is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past or the everexistent pastfantasy future three seconds flat is the usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events 
the senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible inaudible and intactible to them consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions 
if the photographically realistic continuity of dreams however bizarre their combinations denies that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded from views of diverse realities although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life dr h v hilprecht professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania dreamed that a babylonian priest associated with the king kurigalzu #### bc escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic and corrected an error in its identification 
some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription together with other new evidence fully corroborated the ancient priests information dr hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream 
we may conclude that all six points of information ostensibly given by the dream priest could have been furnished by dr hilprechts subconscious reasoning but in denying any physical reality for this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or sudden substitution 
that the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal gradient frequencies across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur met the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determines whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled prevision or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling 
probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot impress us as anything familiar 
if deja vue is an illusion then peculiarly it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most levelheaded people chauncey depew onetime runnerup for the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention at saratoga where he was scheduled to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met 
if depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue but the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene 
one week before the convention depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson gazing at the opposite shore  the food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here 
in this one sentence he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value care for its origin and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients the food does taste good 
situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands these contemporary structures beautifully adapted to a school in the country are home to ## children ages eight to fourteen grades four through eight 
the director walter e clark believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare to him this means caring for the whole child providing basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind 
the school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school in a climate hostile to agriculture mr clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques 
throughout the adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat mr clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil 
 louis bromfields writings excited me as a conservationist by #### he was convinced he would no longer spray 
after reading plowmans folly by edward h faulkner he stopped plowing the basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program poultry for eggs pigs to eat garbage a beef herd and wastes of all kinds 
all these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over ## tons of finished compost a year it was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader 
soon after the method changed visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist when in reality it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this to demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today mr clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth 
 people and soils respond slowly says walter clark but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious longkeeping vegetables due to this enrichment program no chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used 
the carrots sometimes dont make it through the winter the cabbage and squash keep until march or april 
mr clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future a new project planned is the use of biodynamic starter 
 after the soil the kitchen says mr clark the first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread 
at first the kitchen help was tolerant but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves  you cant make french toast with wholewheat bread was an early complaint 
mrs clark as house manager planned the menus and cared for the ordering then miss lillian colman came from vermont to be kitchen manager 
mr clarks studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour once the grains are ground vitamin e begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week 
surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state miss colman pours measures of whole wheat oats and soy beans and turns on the motor 
the bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma it is well liked by the children and faculty 
the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years though at one time that was all they ever served when the chance came they first eliminated cold cereal once a week then gradually converted to hot freshground cereal every day 
occasionally the children find steamed wholewheat grains for cereal which they call buckshot at the beginning of the school year the new students dont eat the cereal right away but within a short time they are eating it voraciously 
the school has received letters from parents asking what happened to johnny he never used to like any hot cereal now thats the only kind he wants 
salads are served at least once a day most come from the root cellar or from the freezer 
sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark lillian did you put nuts in the bread today the school raises enough poultry pigs and beef cattle for most of their needs 
hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility organ meats such as beef and chicken liver tongue and heart are planned once a week 
for deserts puddings and pies are each served once a week most other desserts are fruit in some form fresh fruits once daily at least sometimes at snack time 
apples come from a farm in vermont where they are not sprayed oranges and grapefruit are shipped from florida weekly from an organic farm 
following a talk by mr clark at the new york state natural food associates convention a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from vermont wheatgerm brewers yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce meat loaves 
raw wheatgerm is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged 
the source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues the cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin c content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible 
to solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains on their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail 
they tasted good to him so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds 
parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts but no candy mr clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit hot cereal milk honey wholewheat toast with real butter and eggs 
soup is often the important dish at supper homemade of meat bones and vegetables it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins 
the cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition mr clark felt the school had a good health program 
a vigorous program existed in skiing skating sports and overnight hiking since the change to better nutrition he feels he can report on improvements in health though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof 
the ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment buffeted by swirling winds the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond northfield gulf 
he peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below a plume of smoke rose from a central vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights 
and in the dark days after the great flood of #### the worst natural disaster in the states history the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the united states mails rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of friday november # #### when officials of the post office departments railway mail service realized that their distribution system for vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight 
the states railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rightsofway it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks and once medicine food clothing and shelter had been provided for the floods victims communications and the mail were the next top problems 
the nearest undisrupted end of track from boston was at concord n h when governor al smith offered new york national guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state it seemed a likely temporary solution easing burlingtons bottleneck and that at montpelier too 
there was no such thing as an airport in vermont burlington aviator john j burns suggested the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen and soon a dozen hastilysummoned national guard pilots were bringing their widewinged jenny and dehaviland twoseaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base 
over in barre the streets had been deep in swirling water and bridges were crumpled and gone anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane granite city citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the ###nd infantry vermont national guard laid out runways on wilson flat high on millstone hill 
though the makeshift airports were ready the york state guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule they had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather in and out of established airports and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their world war # planes 
they had to act fast for letters were clogging the terminals down in concord new hampshire was a flier in the right place at the right time robert s fogg a native new englander had been a world war # flying instructor barnstormer and one of the original planners of the concord airport 
piloting a curtiss navy mf flying boat off lake winnipesaukee in #### he had inaugurated the original rural delivery air service in america during the excitement following lindberghs flight to paris earlier in #### dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes 
publicspirited backers staked him to a brandnew airplane aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map the ship was a waco biplane one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled ###/hp wright radial engine known as the whirlwind 
as a matter of fact fogg and his plane didnt get beyond pennsylvania in the race an engine oil leak forced him down but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wryfaced backers so with all this experience bob fogg was a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract 
by airline from concord to burlington is a distance of about ### miles counting a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier the first few days bob fogg set his plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind was right and used wilson flat above barre when it wasnt 
each time in the unhappy pilot pushing his luck begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place preferably on the flattopped hills across the winooski river  but fogg they countered we cant get over there 
it took a tragedy to bring things to a head after a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an army plane strewn across snowcovered towne field 
with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside faced with this situation postmaster charles f mckenna of montpelier went with fogg on a burlington trip and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of berlin 
with a wary eye on the farmers bull fred somers of montpelier and mr st john marked the field with a red table cloth as a wind direction indicator they tied a cotton rag to a sapling 
each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches during the second week of operations fogg received a telegram from the post office department asking him to put on two airplanes and make two flights daily plus one sunday trip 
over the weeks americas first star route air mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation each morning at five fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home 
a sheeplined leather flying suit plus helmet goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit the airmans stock answer to werent you cold 
as daylight began to show through the frosty windows fogg would place a call to william a shaw at the u s weather station at northfield vermont for temperature and windvelocity readings shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station 
later on in the day fogg could get a better weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervised by frank e hartwell out at the airport each morning foggs skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar 
 wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay bob fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven disregarding rain snow and sleet in true postal tradition concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the whirlwinds exhaust overhead 
plane radios were not yet available and once in the air fogg flew his ship by compass a good memory for landmarks as seen from above and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation often threading through the overcast he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skimming above the winooski or the white river along the line of the broken railroad 
the dependable wright engine was never stopped on these trips it ticked over smoothly idling while fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field 
there hed take a compass reading figure his air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minutes hed be over the broad meadows of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him bob fogg didnt have todays advantages of instrument flight and ground control approach systems 
usually back in concord by noon there was just time to get partially thawed out refuel and grab a bit of mrs foggs hot broth before starting the second trip day after day fogg shuttled back and forth on his oneman air mail route until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country 
once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while fogg revved the engine and got the tail up at a nod of his head they let go turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream 
one afternoon during a cold powdery snowstorm fogg took off for concord from the st john field if so are you saying where did the last few years go 
yes retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly somehow we oldtimers never figured we would ever retire 
out of the blue comes talk of pension plans compulsory retirement at sixtyfive looms on our horizon 
suddenly one day up it pops youve thought about it before in a hazy sort of way 
a great many retired people are the socalled white collar workers if so you are of the old school 
also you can spell without consulting a dictionary for every other word you never are late for work and seldom absent 
it is the way you were taught and your way of life all this is standard equipment for a man of your day 
your way doesnt seem to be so darned important any more you realize you are getting in the old fogy class 
now looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals calculated risks and ibm machines this is followed by a boom in conferences 
you had your day and it was a good day well to get back to the problem of retirement 
some have plenty of money some have very little money some are blest with an abundance of good health some are in poor health and many are invalids 
some have beautiful gardens some not even a blade of grass some have serenity of mind the ability to accept what they have and make the most of it a wonderful gift to have believe me some see only darkness the bitter side of everything 
youve got to learn to live with it the question is how are you going to live with it 
but if you do your life will be just one thing unhappiness complete and unabridged it seems to me the first thing youve got to do to be happy is to face up to your problems no matter what they may be 
one thing i am sure of you must get an interest in life many of you will say well what can i do 
find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl if you cant think of a thing to do try something anything 
maybe you are not that gifted either but how about puttering around with the old paints you may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it 
does making your own clothes or even doll clothes interest you do you love to run up a hem sew on buttons make neat buttonholes 
some women can sit and sew crochet tat or knit by the hour and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work where sewing is concerned im a total loss 
then again theres always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs not for me but perhaps just the thing for you 
some people love to crack tile and its amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time do you yearn to make cakes and pies or special cookies and candies 
some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood some make beautiful chairs cabinets chests doll houses etc 
outside of cutting your fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again you might turn out some dandy little gadgets some women get a real thrill out of housework 
i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure thats where it belongs perhaps you would like to become a writer 
will it be short stories fiction nonfiction biography poetry childrens stories or even a book if you are really ambitious ever since i was a child i have always had a yen to try my hand at writing 
just let the rejection slips fall where they may and keep on plugging and finally you will make the grade few new writers have their first story accepted so they tell me 
then theres always hobbies collecting stamps coins timetables salt and pepper shakers elephants dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires i can hear some of you folks protesting 
i havent got that kind of money it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free 
also theres scrap books collecting newspaper pictures and clippings or any items of interest to you as for me i am holding in reserve two huge puzzles i love puzzles to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands 
i just dont have time to do half the things i want to do now so in closing fellow retired members i advise you to make the most of each day enjoy each one to the nth degree 
to one and all good days ahead what does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing frequency these days 
 to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist to produce where nothing was before to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power we are creative it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed 
all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity if it is only to reproduce a form like their own while man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process he is the only animal with a true noninstinctive and conscious creative ability 
mans great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and everchanging forms 
in our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a jules verne come into actuality the vision of a lord tennyson expressed in a poem ### years ago took visible form over london in the air blitzes of #### 
it is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image of his creator not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms but even more importantly he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself 
we know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles by this same combination of the will and the imagination each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be 
so far in history man has been too greatly overoccupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy 
sir julian huxley in his book uniqueness of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote victorian past 
perhaps but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance joking and talking may be freer and easier but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newlymarried men and women 
privacy must be highly assured both in time and place that is locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment 
the consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time day or night for that purpose first intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen 
ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding and suspicion the hymen is in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations 
often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse as might be expected girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity 
so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations but there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folklore beliefs 
more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated 
in recent times when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention obviously the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation 
gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage if he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or preferably to dilate it 
this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act the vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation 
the intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman 
the advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological since it is a purely professional situation none of the pain is associated with lovemaking or the beloved 
in this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl she learns how to relax them to accept instead of contracting them to repel the entering object 
it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation when no medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves 
folklore superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints the long unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of foreplay work on several levels 
extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin but during the same examination two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall the bottom of the vagina in the same position without any pain 
these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind 
at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of lovemaking in fact the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon 
the false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride both physically and psychologically 
the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deepseated dread of marital relations and cause her unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it serious attention must also be given to the husbands problems in the honeymoon situation 
the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax this is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife 
the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again 
he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost now while he uses talk caresses or requires caresses from her his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire 
too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse 
if the early approaches are wise understanding and patient the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures titled the nude a study in ideal form kenneth clark declares the human body as a nucleus is rich in associations 
perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions precipitated by the nude form the wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the kinsey studies in human sexuality 
whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirtyfive years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman boasting an equal number of years of married life is proud of having shared the nudist way of life the really free natural nude life for most of that period 
the indignant crusader sees the nude or seminude human form as lewd and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good or religious or moral persons the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the natural honest free expression of mans spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration 
i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life in nudism who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony 
at its most ecstatic moments husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved 
in the past it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed 
it is she who decides the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics not the husband 
beyond a certain point of course no woman can be dominant nature has seen to that but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed 
yet even in these marriages psychologists say wives are asserting themselves more strongly the meekest most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mothers or grandmothers standards 
they consider it simply a sign of our times our society has emancipated the woman giving her new independence and new authority 
 the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum declares dr mary steichen calderone medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book release from sexual tensions  it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself 
yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous it can in fact wreck a marriage 
and she begins to regard him as savage bestial and unworthy on the other hand wifely supremacy demeans the husband saps his selfrespect and robs him of his masculinity 
 a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husbands maleness declares dr calderone this opinion is supported by one of the nations leading psychiatrists dr maurice e linden director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health 
in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh psychologist an office workers wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded to win her favors her husband first took an additional job then desperately began to embezzle from his employer 
while he was in custody his wife divorced him more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor 
to please her her husband assumed some of the domestic chores finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the children and even ironing and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them 
after every money argument she rebuffed her husbands overtures until the matter was settled in her favor experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed 
she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband the husband is usually a welleducated professional preoccupied with his job often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is dont rock the boat 
hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area more often though he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home 
the wifes attempt at control these psychologists contend is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative 
generally however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wifes mercy  the pattern says dr morton schillinger psychologist at new yorks lincoln institute for psychotherapy is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night 
after all the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr schillinger points out there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom 
they arent frigid and they arent homosexual one such man once confided to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor 
but such cases were in the past unusual society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male even the bible appears to endorse the concept 
and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed this carried over into the more urbanized late ##th and early ##th centuries when the man ruled the roost in the best bullroaring life with father manner 
 grandma wasnt expected to like it dr marion hilliard the late toronto gynecologist once summed up the attitude of the ##s wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands and history indicates they often quite literally were 
some date it from woman suffrage others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin virtually everyone agrees however that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs 
circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over childrearing moneyhandling and home maintenance she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless 
 very few wives says dr calderone who balance the checkbook fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well 
marriage manuals and womens magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax they began to describe in detail the womans capacity for response 
according to dr ellis the average ##yearold american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner not surprisingly dr ellis says some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities 
an aggressive woman wants a man to demand not knuckle under  when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wifes aggressiveness dr linden says the wife in turn finds him inadequate 
one such wife dr linden says became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been conquered and reduced to passivity 
in some cases however domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed the one place he can still be champion 
sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man or his wife because he or she feels age creeping up on the other hand a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive asking psychologists say for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable 
in any case dr calderone remarks such problems are a couples own affair and cant always be measured by a general yardstick  as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little difference if one or the other dominates dr calderone declares 
other experts say however that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period it is likely to shake the marriage and just as domination today often begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband 
he must begin paradoxically by becoming more selfish he must become more expressive of his own desires more demanding and less understanding 
she gave herself a title lady diana harrington the new york da gave her another the golden girl of cafe society

they depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little franklin d lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs claire shaefer accompanied by a friend visited him in bakersfield california several months ago as a prospective patient 
then by squeezing her foot three times he came up presto with a different diagnosis with each squeeze she had he informed her kidney trouble liver trouble and a severe female disorder 
 he knew just the thing for her a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator machine as he applied the applicator extending from the machine which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base to the supposedly diseased portions of mrs shaefers body lee kept up a steady stream of pseudoscientific mumbojumbo 
did she know he asked why the colors of the tubes were important to peoples health the human body he pointed out for example required ## units of blue light 
continuing glibly in this vein he paused to comfort her this machine will cure your cancerridden body 
but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about why i once used this machine to cure a woman with ## pounds of cancer in her body 
when she said that she didnt have the money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one he then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment a can of sage to make her look like a girl again and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away 
after another treatment with the machine he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts he then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine 
leaving lees office mrs shaefer hurried over to her family physician who treated her for burned tissue for several days she was ill as a result of lees treatment 
for mrs shaefer who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau and she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of lees quack shenanigans gathered by the tape recorder under her friends clothing proved adequate in court for convicting franklin d lee 
the sentence ### days confinement in the county jail rather it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases 
with these gadgets impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs ticks and buzzes he then carries out a vicious medical con game capitalizing on peoples respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age he milks the latest scientific advances translating them into his own special buck rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cureall for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer 
he may call himself a anaprapath a physiotherapist an electrotherapist a naturopath a sanipractor a medical cultist a masseur a doctor or what have you not only do these quacks assume impressive titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence 
his plunder is therefore far higher running into hundreds of millions according to the food and drug administration fda doctor ghadiali dr albert abrams and his clique and dr wilhelm reich to name three notorious device quacks succeeded respectively in distributing ##### #### and #### fake health machines 
look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in cleveland sarah gross a dress shop proprietor paid $#### to a masseur and mr a a laborer paid $#### to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines the radioclast and the diagnometer 
you will come up with a frightening total thats why the fda the american medical association ama and the national better business bureau bbb have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $### million or so paid to medical charlatans annually 
similarly the american cancer society acs the arthritis and rheumatism foundation and the bbb have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high for example the bbb has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and ## times as many complaints compared with two years ago 
in this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative the economic toll that the device quack extracts is important of course 
by preying on the sick by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity typically sarah gross and mr a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland quacks 
as a result she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was using were phony she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized 
mr a has recovered but he is justifiably a bitter man  thats a lot of hardearned money to lose he says today 
and there was the case of tom hepker a machinist who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a socalled diagnostic machine for what doctor fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine after his pains got worse tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung 
but hes a welfare case now a human wreck thanks to this modern witch doctor but the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering 
moreover the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide in chicago some time ago mr h age ## a diabetic since he was six stopped using insulin because he had bought a magic spike a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent sold by the vrilium company of chicago for $### as a cureall 
mr h is dead today because he followed this advice doris hull suffering from tuberculosis was taken by her husband to see otis g carroll a sanipractor a licensed drugless healer in spokane 
his prescription hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water although she weighed only ### pounds when she visited him carroll permitted her to go on a ##day fast in which she took nothing but water 
moreover her husband and child contracted tb from her  small wonder a spokane jury awarded the husband $##### for his wifes death 
he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $# to $## from survivors of patients who had died reconditioning them and selling them at $### each when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of ## one of his victims was not around to testify he was dead of cancer 
the evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines substituted for valid medical cures have hastened the deaths of thousands who are the victims of the device quacks 
says wallace f jannsen director of the fdas division of public information quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis rheumatism diabetes and cancer people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks 
they are often ignorant as well as underprivileged tenyearold richard stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year 
mr and mrs stewart were puzzled and concerned then one day dicks classmate jimmy from next door let the cat out of the bag 
when richards parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws their young son was interested during the year that followed dick cooperated wholeheartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance 
what do parents need to know about those years of the braces in order not to waste a childs time and their money how can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment 
occlusion is the dentists expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed malocclusion or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for 
a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth an overdeveloped lower jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion these two basic malformations have of course many variations 
a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw crooked overlapping twisted or widely spaced teeth 
upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close the eyeteeth third from the middle on top counting each front tooth as the first beginning to protrude like fangs 
contrary to the thinking of ## to ## years ago when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition however this does not mean that a childs teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family 
its perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngsters teeth 
malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long if a child loses a molar at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble 
every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth some such youngsters rarely smile or they try to speak with the mouth closed 
yet from the dentists point of view badfitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots 
then too misplaced or jammedtogether teeth are prone to trapping food particles increasing the likelihood of rapid decay  for these and other reasons says dr brodie orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth 
because of these chewing troubles a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping 
in the period from ## to ## the permanent set of teeth is usually completed yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw 
abnormal pressure applied over a period of time produces a change in the bony deposit so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided what can ##yearold susan expect when she enters the orthodontists office 
if he decides to proceed he will custommake for susie an appliance consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone 
this must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows and no faster  if teeth are moved too rapidly serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place explains dr brodie 
during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness but after a short time this will disappear parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay 
next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depending on the severity of her condition during these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth 
but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth 
then comes the time when the last wire is removed and susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months 
an added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct the charge for a complete fullbanded job differs in various parts of the country 
an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $### to $####  factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner says dr brodie 
 costs may seem high but they used to be even higher says dr brodie  fees are about half to a third of what they were ## years ago 
most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years in many cities in the united states clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee 
growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists dr brodie has ##year records of head growth started ## minutes after childrens births 
now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent he says  fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that helps us know what we can do 
for example a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another in the past an orthodontist might have tried over four or five years to straighten and fit the boys large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth would never accommodate them 
the child is kept on call and the orthodontist watches the growth  nature often takes care of the problem says dr brodie 
that is why dr brodie asks parents not to insist against their dentists advice that their child have orthodontic work done too early  both because of our cultures stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so 
superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used and they save time and money 
as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be  after your childs baby teeth are all in usually at the age of two and one half to three its time for that first dental appointment dr brodie advises 
to help prevent orthodontic problems from arising your dentist can do these things he can correct decay thus preventing early loss of teeth 
in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them from time to time the medium mentions other people around him who were on the other side and reports what they are saying 
as the hour progresses the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements there are a few prognoses of coming events 
some mediums speak in practical downtoearth terms while others may stress the spiritual not all as a matter of fact consider themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased 
however that may be people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased or seek indications for future plans 
the mediums with whom the parapsychology foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions instead of talking with a control who speaks through an entranced sensitive what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation 
many a sitter in a personal sitting has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood 
most striking indeed is this beyondnormal ability to put a finger on preconscious moods and to clarify them however in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium he did not receive a personal reading 
for this was to be a proxy sitting as was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive 
he remarked it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter the possibility has to be ruled out that the mediums esp may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central characters in this drama must be separated 
if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name given by the experimenter he cannot possibly give any clues conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions all he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions 
here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator someone close to him who is deceased asking him to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for him in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator nothing else 
as always a tape recording or detailed notes are made and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter so this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the mediums esp and the absent sitters mind 
now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him here again laboratory approaches are being evolved for it is recognized how elastic these readings can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individuals own case 
an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a hit describing something accurately for him but can he really be sure that another sitter hearing the same statement would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances it is of course easy to see how j will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another 
and even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to ones own point of view which is by nature so personal one sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him 
to get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame does that statement really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life 
conversely experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following which if they turned out to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant  he had four children two sets of twins 
part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road methods have been developed of assigning weights to statements 
that fewer women are named miranda than elizabeth that in the united states more people die of heart disease than of smallpox 
specific dates would be important as would double names various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical probabilities against which to measure the readings 
it is very important indeed in the field of extrasensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody 
so after the sitting has been held several readings at one time are mailed and the distant sitter whose name or whose communicators name was given to the medium must mark each little item as correct hit incorrect miss doubtful or especially significant applying to him and he feels not to anyone else he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his 
that is if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him the total experimental score falls conversely if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others a point is chalked up for the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material 
in another approach to the same procedure the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements does she often speak of locations of cause of death 
it is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits now when so to speak the cream has been skimmed off and the items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the sensitive is at her best 
 i feel cold the medium says or my leg aches my head is heavy or perhaps she hears words or sounds theres such a noise of loud machinery or i hear a child crying or he says were all here and glad to see you 
the sensitive often seems to smell definite odors too or subjectively feels emotions sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually there 
if asked how she gets her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them some more vividly than others perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all 
of course there is an element of training here these gifted people by concentration study guidance have learned to develop their power simply using it increases its intensity i was told by one sensitive 
impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium has to translate these into meaning 
during one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail 
in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained though they are often heard clairaudiently as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols a slope to signify the name hill for instance 
the farmers life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock livestock must be tended every day routinely 
even if there are no livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly during the growing season the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily 
such a move may mean a loss of capital hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life 
frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up 
drought hail disease and insects take their toll of crops sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owners earnings even into his capital 
the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a parttime basis land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has subdivision possibilities 
if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high farm labor costs will also be high a parttime farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per acre as can be obtained by a competent fulltime farmer 
he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations such as spraying or threshing and for these he may have to wait his turn there will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his offfarm job 
this may be true whether the farm is owned or rented if the farm is rented the rent must be paid 
a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air 
caring for a calf a pig or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work parttime farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs 
it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health generally the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city 
usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more where schools fire and police protection and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country real estate taxes are usually about the same 
some persons consider the work on a farm recreational for some whitecollar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner 
it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation general requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below 
three quarters to # acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a small flock of chickens a cow and two pigs you could not of course raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small 
in deciding how much land you want take into account the amount youll need to bring in the income you expect but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work 
some parttime farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract 
if you have a yearround fulltime job you cant expect to grow much more than your family uses unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help as a rule parttime farmers hire little help 
list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one 
if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only hand tools you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing however 
if you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor available for $### to $### with attachments #### prices these tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing 
if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a parttime basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs 
before you look for a farm youll need to know # the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake and # whether you want to buy or rent 
if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a parttime farm 
then if you change jobs you wont necessarily have to sell the farm the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable 
if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example you should be close to a town or city 
there are slums in the country as well as in the city a tavern filling station junk yard rendering plant or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value 
find out whether fire protection sewage system gas water mains and electrical lines are available in the locality if these facilities are not at the door getting them may cost more than you expect 
you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water if you are considering a parttime farm where the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled 
pond water can be filtered for human use but most parttime farmers would not want to go to so much trouble the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses 
if you cant tell get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones 
will the house on any parttime farm you are considering make a satisfactory fulltime residence how much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating 
the value of the farm to you will depend on the value of the products you can raise on it 
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town take into account the difference in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and the cost of travel to work 
to do this set up a plan on paper for operating the farm list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year 
the total is the probably gross income from farming to find estimated net farm income subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming 
also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth but charge something for it 
to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge 
one who had been a boy in auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers the gruesome humor of the nazis was not forgotten the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officers 
and still another witness one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendants department of jewish affairs 
would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming if not exhausting effect likely to improve his clients chances those who feared emotionalism at the trial showed less understanding than dr servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies 
but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york in each of the last the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolsheviks and the tightening of stalins dictatorship 
these trials were properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences but what could the eichmann trial initiate 
the eichmann case looked to the past not to the future it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection and of refining the recollection that will last as long as there are jews 
 it is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial said ben gurion and not the nazi regime alone but antisemitism throughout history how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jews without being an antisemite contribute to a verdict against antisemitism 
these questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecutions case it might be contended of course that eichmann in stubbornly denying antisemitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of antisemitism 
in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument one who could be linked to antisemitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the jewbaiter throughout the ages 
yes he believed that the jews were enemies of the reich and such a belief is of course typical of patriotic antisemites but he believed in the jewasenemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things 
in regard to eichmann it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained a principle separate from and far worse than antisemitism a principle by which the poison of antisemitism itself was made more virulent perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer 
at any rate the substance of eichmanns testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success on this score was doubtful and the antisemitic lesson weakened to that extent but if the trial did not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary antisemitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it 
the infamous wansee conference called by heydrich in january #### to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state including the reich minister of the interior the state secretary in charge of the four year plan the reich minister of justice the under secretary of foreign affairs the measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation civilian agencies of government 
in other words the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the jews was but an extension of the antisemitic measures already operating in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on the general antisemitism that had made those measures effective as a readiness for murder this in fact it turned out to be 
whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against antisemitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable antisemite and the concentrationcamp brute 
no doubt many of the citizens of the third reich had conceived their antisemitism as an innocent dislike of jews as do others like them today the final solution proved that the jewbaiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others 
the prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of antisemitism among the germans which hitler stimulated and transformed but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over eichmanns head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned the press seems to have missed it 
certainly one of the best ways of warning the world against antisemitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemyjew can be used to transform the ordinary man of presentday society into a menace to all his neighbors 
the career of eichmann made the trial a potential showcase for antisemitic demoralization fearful of being mistaken for a jew he seeks protection in his nazi uniform clinging to the enemyjew idea he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness 
 is this the type of citizen you desire but though this characterization in no way diminished eichmanns guilt the prosecutor more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one would have none of it 
should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by antisemitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish compatriots from the transports wasnt this meaning of eichmanns experience in various countries worth highlighting 
only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe 
most of the information elicited in jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes tribunals and investigating commissions and by reports memoirs and survivors accounts in poughkeepsie ny in #### a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the planned parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff 
after a flood of protests they were reinstated at the beginning of #### the peace of the community was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the incident felt uneasy 
he thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving protestants jews and roman catholics that continued for two months until the citys board of hospitals lifted the ban on birthcontrol therapy a year later in albany ny a roman catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the planned parenthood association 
these incidents typical of many others dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birthcontrol issue it has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birthprevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and familywelfare agencies 
where it is not actually erupting it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano ready to explode at any moment the time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation 
instead of emotional recrimination loaded phrases and sloganeering we need a dispassionate study of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached  all too frequently points out james ogara managing editor of commonweal catholics run roughshod over protestant sensibilities in this matter by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their jibes at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades 
the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting already existing between catholics and noncatholics concerning the overall objectives of family planning instead of catholics being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring as many noncatholics imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed 
pope pius ## declared in #### that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as those often mentioned in the socalled medical eugenic economic and social indications this means that such factors as the health of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring 
the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons the roman catholic church however sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning 
the roman catholic church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method also known as the use of the infertile or safe period the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of natures laws but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them 
there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement the grounds for the churchs position are scriptural old testament the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early church the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law 
the roman catholic naturallaw tradition regards as selfevident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end this conclusion is based on two propositions that man by the use of his reason can ascertain gods purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain given physical arrangements 
moreover man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws not frustrate or mock them 
but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines without taking up arms against those who disagree with them why is it so different in regard to birth control 
it is always a temptation for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant one to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others both roman catholics and protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past 
many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful with over four million american men away at war protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public 
the attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers racketeers hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history the socalled noble experiment came to an inglorious end 
that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today up to the turn of the century contraception was condemned by all christian churches as immoral unnatural and contrary to divine law 
today the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction the various lambeth conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally 
denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference declared we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children 
the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives in #### the lambeth conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances contraception might be morally legitimate 
many other protestant denominations preceded the anglicans in such action in march #### ## out of ## members of a committee of the federal council of churches ratified artificial methods of birth control 
there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right since then many protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty 
this development is reflected in the action taken in february #### by the general board of the national council of churches the largest protestant organization in the aj the board approved and commended the use of birthcontrol devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning 
the general board declared most of the protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right the general protestant conviction is that motives rather than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception 
this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control 
to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the illstarred prohibition experiment this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief 
only confusion failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin among the chief victims of such an illconceived imposition would be religion itself 
she carried besides her captain a crew of twentyone and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the arctic waters of north america seventeen months later on september # #### an irish fishing boat sighted the discovery limping eastward outside galway bay 
the captain was gone and the mate was gone the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman 
what happened to the fourteen missing men these questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time 
all told they offered a highly confused picture but since #### researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information 
historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations first they wanted to clarify a tantalizing bizarre enigma 
this is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able or ever probably will be able to determine the sailing in the spring of #### was hudsons fourth in four years 
in #### and #### the english muscovy company had sent him northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia twice he had failed and the muscovy company indicated it would not back him again 
this time he turned westward to the middle atlantic coast of north america his chief discovery was important the great north later the hudson river but it produced no northwest passage 
the government forbade hudson to return to amsterdam with his ship he thereupon went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth 
he had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the discovery and had recruited a crew of twentyone the largest he had ever commanded the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear 
one by one the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded in fact hudsons sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes 
nearly twentyfive years before captain john davis had noted as he sailed near the arctic circle a very great gulf the water whirling and roaring as it were the meeting of tides he named this opening between baffin island and labrador the furious overfall 
in #### george waymouth in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded had sailed ### miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the longsought waterway 
on previous voyages it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain on the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of novaya zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will which was obviously not the case 
worse his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before of only one could he be sure young john hudson his second son 
philip staffe the ships carpenter was a good worker but perversely independent arnold lodley and michael perse were like the rest lukewarm ready to swing against hudson in a crisis 
hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer it is believed that hudson was related to other seafaring men of the muscovy company and was trained on company ships 
 the common misconception that he was dutch and that his first name was hendrik stem from dutch documents of his third voyage  in #### hudson was probably in his early forties a good navigator a stubborn voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession 
there at the rivers edge waited one henry greene whom hudson listed as a clerk greene was in actuality a young ruffian from kent who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred pimps panders and whores 
for the first three weeks the ship skirted up the east coast of great britain then turned westward poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called lousie bay 
with hudson looking on his protege greene picked a fight with the ships surgeon edward wilson the issue was settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining ashore determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england 
early in june the discovery passed desolation southern greenland and in midjune entered the furious overfall floating ice bore down from the north and west 
the ships compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole as the bergs grew larger hudson was forced to turn south into what is now ungava bay an inlet of the great strait 
the trouble was at least partly juets doing for weeks he had been saying that hudsons idea of sailing through to java was absurd 
a group of sailors announced to hudson that they would sail no farther instead of quelling the dissension as many captains of the era would have done sir francis drake lopped a mans head off under similar circumstances hudson decided to be reasonable 
patiently he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives when hudson had finished the town meeting broke down into a general wordy argument 
up spoke carpenter staffe who said he wouldnt give ten pounds to be home all through july the discovery picked her way along the ###milelong strait avoiding ice and rocky islands 
to starboard was a cape a thousand feet high patched with ice and snow populated by thousands of screaming sea birds to port was a point ### feet high rising behind to a precipice of #### feet 
hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea now called hudson bay confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific after three weeks swift sailing however the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas 
for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea but the solid bulk of the north american continent this was the bitter end and hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure 
north and south east and west back and forth he sailed in the landlocked bay plowing furiously forward until land appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after week hundreds of miles to the north the route back to england through the furious overfall was again filling with ice 
once more juets complaints were the loudest hudsons reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty 
hudson presiding heard juets defense then called for testimony from crew members juet had made plentiful enemies several men stepped forward 
cook bennett mathues said juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship others added that juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward 
there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves the important result however was that juet and francis clemens the deposed boatswain became hudsons sworn enemies 
once after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed just as it was being hauled inboard a sea hit the ship 
the anchor cable would have been lost overboard but philip staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe thomas douglas fifth earl of selkirk a noble humanitarian scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native highlands conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the red river of the north 
having achieved this end he was able to buy ###### square miles in the valleys of the red and assiniboine rivers the grant which stretched southward to lake traverse the headwaters of the red was made in may #### and by october of that year a small group of scots was settling for the winter at york factory on hudson bay 
seven hundred miles south of york factory at the forks of the red and the assiniboine twentythree men located a settlement in august #### by october the little colony about fort douglas presentday winnipeg numbered ### 
the latter members of two regiments of swiss mercenaries transported by great britain to canada to fight the americans in the war of #### had settled in montreal and kingston at the close of the war in #### selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to red river where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile northwest company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders empire 
it was the low yield of the selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in #### that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward when late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed all but fifty of the scots swiss and metis moved up the red to the mouth of the pembina river 
the new site was somewhat warmer than fort douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food the selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by british fur traders 
when in #### an act of congress forced the foreign firm out of the united states its britishborn employees now become american citizens joseph rolette joseph renville and alexis bailly continued in the fur business on big stone lake near the headwaters of the red river robert dickson superintendent of the western indian department of canada had a trading post and planned in #### to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces 
these carts were of a type devised in pembina in the days of alexander henry the younger about a decade before the selkirk colony was begun in #### henry referred to our new carts as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack 
it was dickson who suggested to lord selkirk that he return to the atlantic coast by way of the united states in september #### at fort daer pembina dickson met the noble lord whom with the help of a band of sioux he escorted to prairie du chien 
upon arriving at baltimore selkirk on december ## wrote to john quincy adams secretary of state at washington inquiring about laws covering trade with missouri and illinois territories this traffic he declared prophetically tho it might be of small account at first would increase with the progress of our settlements 
in #### grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the forks fort douglas and in december #### twenty men left fort daer for the most northerly american outpost at prairie du chien it was a threemonth journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on mackinac boats 
this epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost selkirk ab#### nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to fort daer for food 
activity by british traders and the presence of a colony on the red prompted the united state war department in #### to send lieutenantcolonel henry leavenworth from detroit to put a post ### miles northwest of prairie du chien until then the most advanced united states post in september #### two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the st peters river the head of navigation on the mississippi and began construction of fort st anthony which upon completion was renamed in honor of its commander colonel josiah snelling 
hercules l dousman fur trader and merchant at prairie du chien contracted to supply selkirks people with some ### head of cattle and alexis bailly and francois labothe were hired as drovers bailly after leaving fort snelling in august #### was forced to leave some of the cattle at the hudsons bay companys post on lake traverse in the sieux country and reached fort garry as the selkirk hudsons bay company center was now called late in the fall 
observing their distressing condition colonel snelling allowed these halfstarved immigrants to settle on the military reservation as these swiss were moving from the selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of minnesota dousman of michilimackinac michigan and prairie du chien was traveling to red river to open a trade in merchandise 
alexander mcdonnell governor of red river and james bird a chief factor of the hudsons bay company ordered such sundry articles to a value of ab#### for its part the hudsons bay company was troubled by the approach of american settlement 
accordingly selkirks agents ordered the settlers to move north and by october john halkett had torn down both posts floating the timber to the forks in rafts  i have done everything he wrote to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment 
they would attempt to bring supplies from st louis or prairie du chien at great expense as well as danger at fort garry some of the swiss also decided to cast their lot with the united states and in #### several families paid guides to take them to fort snelling 
after heavy rains and an onslaught of mice snow fell on october ## #### and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the red was five feet thick in april came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until midjune 
by fall ### survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about fort snelling but most of them were sent on to galena and st louis with a few going as far as vevay indiana a notable swiss center in the united states in #### ### red river people with more than ### cattle were living on the reservation at fort snelling 
at the point where they ended another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by father lucian galtier in #### its people including pierre bottineau and other american fur company employees and the refugees from fort garry were joined by the remaining scots and swiss from fort snelling when major joseph plympton expelled them from the reservation in may #### 
while population at fort garry increased rapidly from #### in #### to #### in #### economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate accordingly though the practice violated the notrading provision of the selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the hudsons bay company some settlers went into trade 
despite this prohibiton by #### some of the fort garry merchants were trading with the indians for furs in june #### the governor and council of assiniboia imposed a ## per cent duty on imports via hudsons bay which were viewed as aimed at the very vitals of the companys trade and power 
with their customary source of supply cut off the fort garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the mississippi country others carried pemmican from the forks to st paul and goods from st paul to red river as in the summer of #### when one trader wells transported twenty barrels of whisky to the british settlement

the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world 
historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence # every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions 
# as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness its folklore and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account for group actions to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to become a cohesive force for national identification 
the popularity of local color literature before the spanishamerican war the steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point nor is it an accident that baseball growing into the national game in the last ## years has become a microcosm of american life that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the ####s or that courses in american literature american civilization american anything have swept our school and college curricula 
yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian writer or man in the street it is an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america is spreading her dominion over palm and pine 
anyones identification with an international struggle whether warlike or peaceful requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes 
a heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and everchanging land but we must never forget most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight to answer immediate needs almost always with conscious aims and ends 
abraham lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national constitution robert e lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy 
therefore the scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last ## years will be mindful of two facts # most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all 
folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission it has come to mean myths legends tales songs proverbs riddles superstitions rhymes and such literary forms of expression 
though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter in its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this 
nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and semiisolated ethnic regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material naturally such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore 
as long as his material is americana can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentiethcentury american folklore 
on the other we have the flagwavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material willynilly unfortunately few of the artists writers movie producers dramatists and musicians who have used american folklore since #### have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways 
in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly in an age of print and easy communication within an everexpanding and changing society for that matter the experts themselves are a mixed breed 
they have little esprit de corps the outlook for the amateur for instance is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque 
folklore is his hobby and he all too rightly wishes it to remain as such the amateur is closely related to the collector who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field 
he hunts folklore for the very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located 
but there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts one dominated by money the other by nineteenthcentury german scholarship both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found 
the commercial propagandist who cant afford to be critical gets along well with the amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the analysts toes by refusing to keep his material genuine his standards are of course completely foreign to those of the analyst 
dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although he cannot deny his debt to the collector the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors 
publishers want books that will sell recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint but moral material the analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in 
they see it as a potpourri of charming moral legends and patriotic anecdotes with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the moneymaker that even at the college level most of the hundredodd folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone 
and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each does the writer know the difference between an ersatz ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk 
is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that was or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be 
in the first place a good many writers who are said to use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale robert frost for instance writes about rural life in new england but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems 
in the second place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than frost to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material stephen vincent benets john browns body comes immediately to mind in this connection as does john steinbecks the grapes of wrath and carl sandburgs the people yes 
folklore as used by such writers really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it the folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude 
nevertheless with a reading public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness of our expanding international interests it is easy for the benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of americana real or fake and it is easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk as part of the same arrangement torrio had in the spirit of peace and good will and in exchange for armed support in the april election campaign bestowed upon obanion a third share in the hawthorne smoke shop proceeds and a cut in the cicero beer trade 
he had a round frank irish face creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someones body he carried three guns one in the right trouser pocket one under his left armpit one in the left outside coat pocket and was equally lethal with both hands 
the police credited him with twentyfive murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol 
he had no apparent comprehension of morality he divided humanity into right guys and wrong guys and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under 
he walked with a heavy list to the right as that leg was four inches shorter than the other but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns landesco thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was in fact with his aggression and hostility and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain a casebook psychopath 
obanion was born in poverty the son of an immigrant irish plasterer in the north sides little hell close by the sicilian quarter and death corner he had been a choir boy at the holy name cathedral and also served as an acolyte to father obrien 
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood and went through the normal pressurecooker course of thieving policedodging and housebreaking at the age of ten when he was working as a newsboy in the loop he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg 
in his teens obanion was enrolled in the vicious market street gang and he became a singing waiter in mcgoverns cafe a notoriously low and rowdy dive in north clark street where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out he then got a job with the chicago heraldexaminer as a circulation slugger a rough fighter employed to see that his papers news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors 
obanions first conflict with the police came in #### at seventeen when he was committed to bridewell prison for three months for burglary two years later he served another three months for assault 
but by now obanions political pull was beginning to be effective on the occasion of his #### indictment the $##### bond was furnished by an alderman and the charge was nolle prossed 
the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted at a cost of $##### in bribes it was estimated as promptly as torrio obanion jumped into bootlegging 
unlike the sicilians he additionally conducted holdups robberies and safecracking expeditions and refused to touch prostitution he was also personally active in ward politics and by #### obanion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state i always deliver my borough as per requirements 
there was a questionandanswer gag that went around at that time q wholl carry the fortysecond and fortythird wards a obanion in his pistol pocket 
to forestall any change of allegiance the democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for obanion as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay the reception was held in a private dining room of the webster hotel on lincoln park west 
the guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of american civic life at this time it included the top obanion men and chief of detectives michael hughes 
hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of jerry oconnor the proprieter of a loop gambling house  but when i arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters i had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times i knew i had been framed and withdrew almost at once 
there was a brief interruption while one of obanions men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip then obanion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds 
pasley continued they became an institution of the chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in ###### however this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever 
on election day november # he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men bribers and experts in forging repeat votes the result was a landslide for the republican candidates 
in the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric selfconfidence and selfaggrandisement for their liking he behaved publicly with a cocky swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine latin minds and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness 
to settle this slight obanion went down to the la salle theatre in the loop where he had learned dave miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy at the end of the performance dave and max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters 
a second bullet ricocheted off maxs belt buckle leaving him unhurt but in some distress obanion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre 
a further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a torrio beer convoy on a west side street and demanded $### to let it through one of the beerrunners telephoned obanion on a line tapped by the detective bureau and reported the situation 
why i can get them knocked off for half that much upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if obanion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen 
he says he dont want no trouble but torrio and capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the irishman 
they had suffered in sulky silence the sight of his sharp practice in cicero when as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the april election torrio had given obanion a slice of cicero the profits from that district had been $##### a month 
these booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the sheldon saltismcerlane and drugganlake gangs and now they were competing for trade with the torriocapone saloons once again obanions brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will 
but he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate at last even the controlled torrio was unable to hold still and he tentatively suggested that obanion should take a percentage in the stickney brothels in return for one from his cicero beer concession 
still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the obanion gangs seizure from a west side marshalling yard of a freightcar load of canadian whisky worth $###### and by one of the biggest coups of the prohibition era the sibley warehouse robbery which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation here was stored $####### worth of bonded whisky 
a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an earthquake or a volcanic eruption the most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in #### 
the ancient greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves whether or not platos tale of the lost continent of atlantis is true skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times 
one of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous lisbon earthquake of november # #### its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast 
they are far more common in the pacific japan has had ## destructive ones eight of them disastrous since #### 
in #### an earthquake in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the inland sea one wave swamped more than #### ships and boats in osaka bay 
in #### a japanese tsunami killed ##### people and swept away ##### homes the dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement 
but a tsunami often extends more than ### miles and sometimes as much as ### miles from crest to crest while a wind wave never travels at more than ## miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour 
lagranges law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of ### miles per hour 
their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights 
not until they sailed home at the end of the day through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses were they aware of what had happened the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from ## to ### feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore 
they usually range from ## to ## feet in height but when they pour into a vshaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers 
reefs are left high and dry and the beaches are covered with stranded fish at hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach 
after an earthquake in japan in #### people on the coast at tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground when a second quake came they dashed back to the beach fearing that they might be buried under landslides 
a tsunami is not a single wave but a series the waves are separated by intervals of ## minutes to an hour or more because of their great length and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over 
usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest among the observers of the #### tsunami at hilo was francis p shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography one of the worlds foremost marine geologists 
their onrush and retreat he reported was accompanied by a great hissing roaring and rattling the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest 
they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come in hilo bay they were from ## to ## feet high 
scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange byproducts of the phenomenon during a #### tsunami in japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night 
japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottomliving diatoms raised to the surface by the disturbance 
gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands the tsunamiwarning system developed since the #### disaster in hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by commander c k green of the coast and geodetic survey staff 
but when waves with a period of between ## and ## minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit this in turn sets off an alarm notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress 
the moment the alarm goes off information is immediately forwarded to honolulu which is the center of the warning system this center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with seismographs 
by means of charts showing wavetravel times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps 
since the #### disaster there have been ## tsunami in the pacific but only one was of any consequence on november # #### an earthquake occurred under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula 
within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in alaska arizona and california the quakes epicenter was placed at ## degrees north latitude and ### degrees east longitude while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water the hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at #### greenwich time 
they hurled a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor knocked down telephone lines marooned automobiles flooded lawns killed six cows but not a single human life was lost and property damage in the hawaiian islands did not exceed $###### 
but it is plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves 
life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man the land too is changing and earthquakes are daily reminders of this 
sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface often the shifts cannot be seen but they are there 
todays earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earths restlessness is presently concentrated but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them the effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized even overemphasized 
superstition has often blended with fact to color reports we have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earths interior for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled 
earthquakes originate as far as ### miles below the surface but they do not occur at greater depths two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts 
 # if earthquakes do occur at such depths why not deeper knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields 
we have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l don leet 
a sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll in irelands county limerick near the river shannon there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which means garden of owen 
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of cheyennes sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists in korea garryowen is the battle cry of the #th us cavalry regiment the fighting seventh 
but dont tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh especially in a saloon on saturday night of all the thousands of men who have served in the #th cav perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel melbourne c chandler 
the truth is however that when mel chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil chandler had been commissioned in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it 
the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h #th cavalry in the middle of corps maneuvers in japan outside of combat he couldnt have landed in a tougher spot 
second if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him its on maneuvers in combat helping your co make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed 
but his first few days with troop h were full of surprises beginning with first sergeant robert early chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice 
he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade there was no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blindfolded 
further he had taken full advantage of the armys correspondence courses he not only knew soldiering but mathematics history and literature as well 
he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army 
for example it was a battalion of the #th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn it didnt take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj 
maneuvers over the #th returned to garrison duty in tokyo captain chandler still with them it was the #th cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the imperial palace of the emperor 
it happened at the st patricks day party a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over threequarters of a century to the strains of an irish march in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each beaming above the biggest greenest shamrock he had ever seen 
and when the singing began it was the gouldings who sang the old irish songs the best though there was an occasional goodnatured chuckle about marvin goulding the jewish officer from chicago singing tearfully about the ould sod no one really thought it was strange 
it was no coincidence that goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment and so mel chandler got the spirit of garryowen 
one of his innovations was to see to it that every man cook and clerk as well as rifleman qualified with every weapon in the troop even the mess sergeant bill brown a dapper cocky transfer from an airborne division went out on the range 
carroll was sharp and military but he was up against tough competition for that ra berth and he wanted to play it cool so mel chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold a short time before 
its entire complement of noncommissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across luzon in world war # just a month after the korean war broke out the #th cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat 
one night on the naktong river mel chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side 
at # oclock on the morning of august ## they were in doubt no longer the enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of #### men armed with russian machine guns attacked the position held by chandlers men 
they were followed by crack north korean troops who mounted one charge after another they overran the #th cavs forward machinegun positions through sheer weight of numbers over piles of their own dead 
captain chandler saw that it was building up strength he assembled a group of ## men composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation the company clerk supply men cooks and drivers and led them to the hill 
chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight he took one step two broke into a trot and then into a run 
his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran the koreans fell back but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire 
it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of garryowen he had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge 
but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously he went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire 
they found it at the junction between troops h and g and prepared to counterattack  okay men he said 
but the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and marvin goulding fell dead for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that their lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment was dead 
they charged into the enemy like wild men that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun 
reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by gouldings platoon the north koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies 
though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade he lived today he is a major in the regular army 
after years of digging nights and weekends he put together the big profusely illustrated book of garryowen and glory which is probably the most complete history of any military unit the battle of the naktong river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off 
take the case of major marcus a reno who survived the battle of the little big horn in #### from the enlisted men he pistolwhipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno 
but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him the men who had seen reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the sioux refused to say a harsh word against him he was a member of the fighting seventh 
brevet major general george armstrong custer was the regiments first permanent commander and like such generals as george s patton and terry de la mesa allen in their rise to military prominence custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare during the civil war custer who achieved a brilliant record was made brigadier general at the age of ## 
i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are selfevident in the sense that everyone agrees with them if they were walter lippmann would be writing the same columns as george sokolsky and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about 
the ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity and in particular since this is our special responsibility that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states 
these conditions are unobtainable are not even approachable in the qualified sense i have indicated without the prior defeat of world communism this is true for two reasons because communism is both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these conditions 
moreover as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote it follows that victory over communism is the dominant proximate goal of american policy 
but dominant in the sense that every other objective no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it but if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin then we must fight 
but if granting selfdetermination to the algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the sinosoviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postponed but if justice for bantus entails driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west then the bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer 
it may be of course that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world the absence of soviet communist power 
this brings us squarely to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that it always has been that it always will be 
in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus the other for the most part true 
i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention you may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment i certainly do but you know any comparison of overall american strength with overall soviet strength finds the united states not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of ussoviet relations for the foreseeable future 
suppose he says that the tables were turned and we were in the soviets position there would be more than #### modern soviet fighters all better than ours stationed at ### bases in mexico and the caribbean overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast 
add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength 
the other charge was that americas political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years the contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it 
prestige however is only a minor part of the problem and even then it is a concept that can be highly misleading 
but contrary to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important for its own sake only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be 
the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is weaker than the soviet union and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead this ignorant estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself 
to the extent then that declining us prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there is reason for concern still these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves 
and is western influence greater or less than it used to be in answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded the success of communisms war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests 
communist political warfare we must remember is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes in mob uprisings in the streets in parliaments in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators at the united nations on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences preferably at the highest level 
thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover is to neutralize a country the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy 
the kremlins goal is the isolation and capture not of ghana but of the united states and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a neutralist mask yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the soviet foreign office to recite the particulars of recent soviet successes is hardly reassuring 
laos is teetering between communism and procommunist neutralism cambodia is for all practical purposes neutralist 
today sukarnos government is heavily besieged by avowed communists and for all of its neutralist pretensions it is a firm ally of soviet policy ceylon has moved from a prowestern orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west 
today the nasser and kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the west are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel in almost every particular follow the kremlins foreign policy line 
never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoyed wilsonian selfdetermination the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west today africa is swerving violently away from the west and plunging it would seem into the soviet orbit 
one latin american country cuba has become a soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico panama and venezuela are displaying open sympathy for castroism and there is no country save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged where castroism and antiamericanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the american cause

there was the hungarian revolution which we praised and mourned but did nothing about there was the polish revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests 
only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing communist power in guatemala and contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside pressures and world opinion to bring down that communist government

a traditional lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad and the remedy was to make all possible noise ideally with firearms the din was successful too for just before the moon disappeared the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again which meant good luck all around

i saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered

i was careful to keep my feet the seat of the least worthy spirits from pointing at anyones head where the worthiest spirits reside now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us 
those souls like to wander off and must be called back with the divinities present and our souls in place we were wished health happiness and power 
these were to be kept on to hold in the ## souls as we stepped out into the sunlight a man came up to john cool and silently showed him his hand 
john said i have some antiseptic salve with me but its too late for that my interviews with teenagers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds 
 being jewish gives you tremendous drive a boy remarked  it means that you have to get ahead 
 i like the tradition a girl said  i like to follow the holidays when they come along 
as i see it theres no real difference between being jewish catholic or protestant another teenager remarked most jews dont believe in god but they believe in people in helping people 
when asked how this was different from being a good protestant the boy answered its the same thing this accords with the study by maier and spinrad 
the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in ## per cent to get happiness for yourself ## per cent 
however they were hostile to jewish orthodoxy professing to believe in judaism but in a moderate way one boy said querulously about orthodox jews its the twentieth century and they dont have to wear beards 
 we were brought up that way was one statement which won general assent  i want to show respect for my parents religion was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of judaism 
intermarriage which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval most of the teenagers i interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds 
a fourteenyearold girl from the middle west observed wryly that in her community religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious it appears that an orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and in addition required kosher food 
this is no doubt inaccurate but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely collegeoriented 
this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large ### per cent for males and ### per cent for females this may help explain a phenomenon described by a smalltown jewish boy 
however in their junior and senior years they generally forego their athletic pursuits presumably in the interest of better academic achievement it is significant too that the older teenagers i interviewed believed unlike the younger ones that jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts 
the motivations for both sexes to be sure are different the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed 
it is they who read and make jewish bestsellers and then persuade their husbands to read them in upper teen jewish life the noncollege group tends to have a sense of marginality 
however among the girls there are some moraleenhancing compensations for not going to college the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office in contradistinction to gentile factory workers and buttressed by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student 
one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teenagers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia 
perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college constituting ## per cent of those who attend the day session can serve as a paradigm of the urban lowermiddle class jewish student there is to begin an important sex difference 
first the girls education has a lower priority than the sons second the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son 
the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically one can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town 
on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school this is particularly acute for those who attended midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college 
at the same time there is a good deal of selfcongratulation at attending a good college they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues and they express pleasure at the cozy ingroup feeling that the college generates  its people of your own kind a girl remarked 
of course i would like to go to an outoftown school where there are all kinds of people but i would want lots of jewish kids there for most brooklyn college students college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family 
however a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping 
 they dont like it if i do anything away from home its so much trouble i dont usually bother 
parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or house plan meeting a freshman girls father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the lowdown on a boy who was going out with his daughter 
under pressure from parents the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that coordinates best with marriage plans limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours this means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature 
the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual first the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights 
it is significant that the catskills which used to be the summer playground for older teenagers a kind of summer suburb of new york no longer attracts them in great numbers except for those who work there as waiters bus boys or counselors in the day camps but it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places fire island nantucket westhampton long island for example tend to be homogeneously jewish 
in general however the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith and acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years 
there are hordes of nubile young women there who prodded by their impatient mothers are determined to marry it is interesting that although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at brooklyn than elsewhere about ## per cent of the women and ## per cent of the men in the graduating class the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate 
and the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities sororities and houses in the house plan association that have good news to impart these announcements are in effect advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts 
 witt house happily announces the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house the brooklyn college student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models 
the girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant hairdos despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel are not unknown even in early morning classes among the boys there is very little bravado about drinking 
the fort lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys this should be used frequently but shaken before using 
this could also be used for any other skin irritation or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts 
at least i have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection one for hastening delayed menstruation bruises burns cuts etc occurred frequently on the frontier and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too 
 doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain  salted butter was another cure for bruises 
the burn oozed watery fluid for many days and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts another swore by vinegar baths for burns and still another recommended salted butter 
this was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil when it was cool the fat was skimmed off and bottled 
one man badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time a sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat 
the results were good but which treatment helped is still not known to stop bleeding cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds 
this would stop the flow and also prevent infection my lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds 
he showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated a chaw of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing 
one old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head his brother ran a mile to get the father 
then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place there was no cleaning or further care but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar 
until quite recently sterile maggots could be bought to apply to a wound they would feed on its surface leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated 
one family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips or if these were not handy plain lard another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke 
in #### there were known to be twentytwo in norton county and one had been in the family for ### years another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker 
since a fall or blow might have caused it a cold pack was usually first aid this might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck pressed on the upper lip or inserted into the nostril cotton was usually used in this last 
or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water 
felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven pounding it fine and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part 
many an oldtimer swore by the saliva method  get a bite spit on it was a proverb 
not long ago denver mud was most popular chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived 
bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing 
for wasp stings onion juice obtained by scraping an onion gave quick relief a handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water 
just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days 
bed slats were washed in alum water legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate applied with a feather kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests 
a kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment but it did the job to remove an insect from ones ear warm water should be inserted 
as the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look crosseyed 
shingles were cured by gentian an old drug used in combinations for erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth 
winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped to cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water 
six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow 
another remedy was oil of eucalyptus used as well for chilblains chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves 
a german informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree steeped in water until it formed a sticky gummy solution 
one veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or fire another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight 
one young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days 
wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments and strangely enough many warts did just that one wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy 
a simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way one person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water 
another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave 
sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub sore feet by calfsfoot an herb from the pioneers ubiquitous herb garden or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved 
this does give relief as i can testify one doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps 
for sprains and swellings one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief except for the wine waiter in a restaurant always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are ones dealer and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him 
it may on occasion be anything but that however by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters and better yet whether he has a taste for wine 
this is important because despite all the efforts of the french government an appreciable segment of frances export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards or the best parts of them 
these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one drinks the grands crus on a mealtomeal basis the grands crus are expensive and even doting palates tire of them 
there is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper some of them are very delicious indeed and there are many good ones exported unfortunately along with others not so good and worse 
especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal their importance mounts most of them the world over operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof on the customer himself 
 is for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the supply would dry up in no time at all this is the only valid and extenuating argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter 
faced on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence the one way to get around them short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money 
wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served this is especially true of red wines and a practice which though not always practicable is well worth the effort 
wine stored for a long time should be on its side otherwise the cork dries and air enters to spoil it 
fat bottles such as burgundies have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper reclining posture too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks again with ill effects 
if it smells of cork one has grounds for suspicion seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it prematurely 
consequently ones wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces if one lives near a subway or an express parkway the solution is to have ones wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time 
all in all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking many people go to extreme lengths in decanting chilling or warming or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork 
but the fact remains that in most restaurants including some of the best of paris and bordeaux and dijon the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal a white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator the former is far preferable in about fifteen minutes 
though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time it may be a bit cold when poured 
in this way red wine warms of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages the only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire 
it should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in halfbottles less fast in full bottles slowly in magnums and slower yet in tregnums double magnums jeroboams methuselahs and imperiales respectively very old red wines often require several hours of aeration and any red wine brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncorked and allowed some air 
thus sauternes or barsacs should be very cold a pouillyfuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold 
the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air to quote professor saintsbury the last glass of claret or burgundy is as good as the first 
this does not mean though that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration there is a reasonable limit and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day after they have once been opened are never as good if this must be done they should always be corked and kept in a cool place 
a few red wines notably those of the beaujolais are better consumed at cellar temperature by tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature if anything a little cooler and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well 
very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself a tugofwar between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea 
many people use wicker cradles for old red wine lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without disturbing the sediment another school frowns on such a shortcut and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle 
the wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines be decanted it may also be practically speaking a matter of good economy 
though there are many exceptions which we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three and ten red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer 
some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more if a red bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid or cloying and muddytasting leave it alone for a while 
giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically rest assured that your accompanying letter of instructions shall be in the letter and spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation 
william who lived in neighboring st marys parish had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year giffen advised acceptance of this plan citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation 
early in january #### he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of gorhams intention henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother the emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs he contended but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless negroes 
gorham refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved the suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic since no planter would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves 
william who did not write to gorham told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would sue amicably to protect his interests palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation 
a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement 
if not he was willing to accede to williams wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim william was adamant on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and henrys slaves if they were told of their coming freedom 
lacking specific instructions he agreed to williams condition in march there was a division of the slaves and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible 
 i considered that your views would be best carried out he explained by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of emancipation i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience & justice 
if palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited this cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper devoid of compassion or humanity was all he needed 
old sams sixtyfive years had reduced his value to $### rose a twelveyearold with childbearing potential was worth $### 
palfreys brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $###### thus twenty black souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men 
despite giffens warning palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in louisiana yet even if he could get the necessary approval fourteen of his negroes could not be manumitted without special permission 
palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement otherwise freedom would mean removal from the state in which as the place of their past residence from birth or for many years it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain 
news of the legislative veto appeared in the new orleans papers and henry and william became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance henry stormed into giffens office waving a copy of the new orleans courier shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair and that it would reach the ears of the people on the plantation and make them restless & unhappy 
when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey gorham readily assented vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him in view of these difficulties palfrey decided to go to louisiana 
his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in midapril palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for new orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again 
in both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the north in new york lydia maria child welcomed him enthusiastically i have lately heard of you from the legislature of louisiana and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man 
she agreed to take charge of five or six of the negroes should palfrey decide to send them north immediately at lexington kentucky palfrey consulted with cassius m clay on the same subject but with no apparent result 
instead of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark on whom i had no sort of claim & have had many more invitations than i could accept he later told abolitionist edmund quincy of the marked attention and civility with which the new orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him 
palfreys autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of attakapas many of whom were coarse & passionate people much excited by what they heard of my plans he proceeded with his task bravely in his memoirs at least before the passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high 
the women by remaining behind condemned their children born and unborn to bondage he had a short private talk with each adult slave 
all the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season so that they could get in their own little produce the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account 
palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience from cambridge palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves 
should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier giffen was to provide passage at once when a sailing date of march #### was finally established palfrey made sure that the negroes would have comfortable quarters in new orleans and aboard ship 
palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout #### the plantation was sold in january #### and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months wages 
the new owner at attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement on march ## #### the bark bashaw weighed anchor at new orleans while on the levee henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their fathers former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation 
giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants two of these were included in palfreys lot 
after an initial rejection which he attributed to a general excitement against abolition and emancipation giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury and got the permission without further delay when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were of course no longer slaves 
nevertheless palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at kings chapel to formalize the emancipation an eyewitness recalled how awkward the redturbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free 
palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a negro boy in the hopedale community but he had better luck in his other attempts mrs child true to her word helped place anna and her four children with a quaker family named hathaway near canandaigua new york

they arrived in washington about the same time during the early postwar years kennedy as the young congressman from massachusetts walton after a wartime stint with timelife to become bureau chief for the new republic 
walton who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capitals leading semiabstract painters vows that he and kennedy never once discussed art in those days during last years campaign kennedy asked walton an utter novice in organization politics to assist him 
walton who served as a correspondent with general james gavins paratroopers during the invasion of france combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy he provoked outraged editorials when after a postinaugural inspection of the white house with mrs kennedy he remarked to reporters we just cased the joint to see what was there 
a man of great talent he will continue to serve as a sort of presidential troubleshooter strictly ex officio for culture a more official representative is the secretary of the interior 
but even while sparring furiously with republican politicians he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments his private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as c p snow arnold toynbee and aaron copland 
after promoting frosts appearance at the inauguration he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of cabinet members members of congress and other washington notables gathered in the state department auditorium the event was so successful that the interior secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the administration 
one tempest was stirred up last march when udall announced that an eightandahalffoot bronze statue of william jennings bryan sculpted by the late gutzon borglum would be sent on indefinite loan to salem illinois bryans birthplace spokesmen for the nations traditionminded sculptors promptly claimed that udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form 
hoping to cut down on such works udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized he is not likely to win this battle easily 
the last congress adopted seven bills for memorials including one to taras shevchenko the ukrainian poet laureate active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first roosevelt on theodore roosevelt island in the potomac and trs own living children who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary 
 washington president kennedy has been heard to remark ironically is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm there have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation commencing with the white house 
ever since the fire of #### destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by president thomas jefferson the white house has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces few of them authentic or aesthetic mrs kennedy shows a determination to change all this 
it now serves the president in his oval office later browsing in an old issue of the gazette des beauxarts she found a description of a handsome gilt piertable purchased in #### by president james monroe 
but it soon became clear that the search for eighteenthcentury furniture which mrs kennedy feels is the proper period for the white house must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms the first lady appointed a fine arts advisory committee for the white house to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them 
by rough estimate her committee headed by henry francis du pont contains three times as many republicans as democrats the press releases emanating from the white house give a clue to the activity within 
the american institute of interior designers is redecorating the white house library secretary and mrs dillon have contributed enough pieces of empire furniture including dolley madisons own sofa to furnish a room in that style 
womans place is in the home man must attend to matters of the yard one of the vexatious problems to first confront president kennedy was the property lying just across pennsylvania avenue from the white house 
while a senator kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the belasco theater as well as the dolley madison and the benjamin taylor houses all scheduled for razing what to do about it now that he was president 
kennedy made a midnight inspection of the square then he called in his friend walton and turned over the problem to him with instructions to work out what was best provided it didnt pile unnecessary burdens on the president 
but judge marvin jones senior member of the court is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby metropolitan club and desires to walk to work more importantly he also happens to be the brotherinlaw of sam rayburn speaker of the house 
on delving deeper walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the square could be classified as early nondescript the old belasco theater over which many people had grown sentimental was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a uso center 
 the attempt to save the squares historic value he declares came half a century too late surrounded by ancient elms the campus is spacious and beautiful 
but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go far even though he may go fast for sophisticated pleasures he is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence if he chooses to be 
the mens shops on hanovers main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke are no less rakish than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia 
the wouldbe sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment no one here pokes fun at manly virtues 
thus when dartmouths winter carnival widely recognized as the greatest wildest roaringest college weekend anywhere any time was broadcast over a national television hookup prexy john sloan dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb topped off by a tamoshanter which he confessed had been acquired from a smith girl president dickeys golden retriever frolicking in the snow at his feet added to the picture of masculine informality 
dean thaddeus seymour wearing ski clothes was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the carnival she must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head 
for example groups regularly canoe down the connecticut river this is in honor of john ledyard class of #### who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days 
they are hailed by the nations press and smith girls throng the riverbanks at northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses dartmouths favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing 
yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the intercollegiate ski union which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter starting with their own front door 
the dartmouth skiway at holts ledge ten miles north of the campus has one of the best terrains in the east ranging from novice to expert forty miles farther north is mount moosilauke dartmouths own mountain 
the lodge built of handhewn virgin spruce can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or lounging in its huge living room the outing club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters extending from the vermont hills just across the river from the college through hanover to the college grant ##### acres of wilderness ### miles north up in the logging country 
the club runs regular trips to the cabins but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting fishing climbing or skiing under the auspices of the outing club dartmouth also has the mountaineering club which takes on tough climbs like mount mckinley and bait & bullet whose interests are selfevident and even sports a woodmans team which competes with other new england colleges in wood sawing and chopping canoe races and the like 
city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp and on the summit of mount washington where thirtyfive degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the himalayas because it is there 
their affection for their college home has even caused president dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather specially hanoverian probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states 
it fixed on dartmouth college which was readymade and just what the proctor ordered the legislators decided to liberate dartmouth and entered into a tugowar with the college trustees over the control of classrooms faculty and chapel 
the struggle was resolved in #### in the supreme court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history in #### the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters 
in an age of oratory he was the king of orators and both he himself and chief justice marshall were bathed in manly tears as uncle danl reached his thundering climax  it is sir as i have said a small college and yet there are those who love it 
this is not out of keeping with its origins probably the most humble of any in the ivy group eleazar wheelock a presbyterian minister founded the school in #### naming it after the second earl of dartmouth its sponsor and benefactor 
and also of english youth and any others it was a hardy undertaking and wheelocks was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness 
the governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gatherings 
then from the branches of a nearby tree an indian underclassman disdaining both the platform and the english language harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue governor wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the threehundredfoot pines and a barrel of rum was broached 
future commencements were more decorous perhaps but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace by the end of the nineteenth century in #### when the big three columbia and penn were populous centers of learning dartmouth graduated only sixtynine 
then in #### dr william jewett tucker became president and the colleges great awakening began he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college 
and at his last commencement in that year dr tucker and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college the presidents of cornell wisconsin ccny bowdoin vermont brown columbia princeton yale and harvard and the presidents emeritus of harvard and michigan were there 
but it has achieved a crosssection of students from almost all the states and twothirds of its undergraduates come from outside new england over ### different schools are usually represented in each entering class 
about twothirds of the boys now come from public schools it is still a college only and not a university 
however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums the dartmouth medical school third oldest in the country and founded in #### the thayer school of engineering and the amos tuck school of business administration all three are purposely kept small with a current total enrollment of about two hundred 
students of the college who are candidates for the ab degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the twoyear postgraduate course in one year the thayer school offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy wins a bs in engineering 
it is still however the junior member of the league if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do it has not been a wellknown school for any part of the span the other ivies have enjoyed 
it has come on with a rush in more significant areas today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking 
president emeritus hopkins once proposed to corral an aristocracy of brains in hanover the person who left the buggy there has never been identified 
there are of course many weaknesses in any case against emma she didnt like her stepmother but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage 
she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels if she avoided the train and hired a buggy the stableman might have recognized her 
uncle john vinnicum morse was the immediate popular suspect his sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer 
it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her uncle morse at that time jennings had a young law associate named arthur s phillips 
he said morse and borden had quarreled violently in the house that day information which must have come from lizzie it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door 
notice knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden he said he would have convicted somebody 
they were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters fall river police did go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men 
he said he returned from the visit to his niece on the #### streetcar the woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner 
it is possible that morse told the woman it was #### but it could have been earlier since she did serve dinner on time police did make an attempt to check on morses alibi 
questioned further morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so morses statement really proved nothing 
bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door 
he met nobody he knew on this walk there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs borden was killed 
she said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that mrs borden told her to wash the windows this was long after morse had left the house 
he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone and despite knowltons attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum this was not true 
it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied 
he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm mrs borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out 
if he took an earlier streetcar than the #### on his return he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr borden came home with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to the house 
his unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree with crowds already gathering in front of the building and sawyer guarding the side door was odd there was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains and certainly no scientific test was made of them 
the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel there was no financial gain for morse in the murders 
the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior he said he had promised mrs borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house 
 the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr morse as in possession of guilty knowledge neither had any interest in the deaths 
both he and bridget were exonerated by lizzie herself that was his complete discussion of bridget sullivan as a possible suspect 
he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl the exoneration pearson speaks of is not an exoneration but lizzies expression of her opinion as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet 
fleet asked the same question about bridget and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her fathers murder and came down when she called her lizzie actually never named any suspect 
and much as she detested hiram harrington she also did not accuse him at the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings toward her father 
they have not been friendly for years asked who this was she named harrington 
when i interviewed kirby who as a boy picked up pears in the borden yard i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders he said he had not heard of anybody else 
kirby was of course reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget sullivan 
true it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations the actions of bridget should be examined since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her innocence 
the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to the detriment of lizzie 
bridget was born in ireland one of fourteen children she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time 
she finally settled in fall river and after being employed for a time by a mrs reed was hired by the bordens i have previously described how during the week of the murder bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes 
a gentleman of the old school mr upton possessed intellectual power ample means and withal was a devoted christian the daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects 
there is clear evidence that lucy from childhood had an unusual mind she possessed an observant eye a retentive memory and a critical faculty 
she named ## items and said there were many more things which it would take too long to write an essay on freedom written at ## years of age quoted the declaration of independence the freedom given to slaves in canada and the views of george washington 
and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied a picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate albert s flint friend of her brother winslow and later like winslow a noted astronomer 
the study of greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college and lucy upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men the death of her mother in #### prevented this 
but even so lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits when her brother winslow became a student at brown university in #### she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under professor diman what is prof dimans definition of civilization and take the world through is its progress ever onward or does it retrograde at times 
many years later on august # #### lucy upton wrote winslows daughter soon to be graduated from smith college while i love botany which after dabbling in for years i studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being that was my favorite study 
la croix on the customs of the middle ages ## chapters of bryce and liked it more and more she discussed in her letters to winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone 
also lucy and winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in importunately who won is not revealed but winslows daughter eleanor says they got up to #### words 
at different times he served as gleeclub and choir leader and as organist and it was lucy upton who first started the idea of a regular course in music at spelman college 
for three years he was connected with the us naval observatory and with the us signal corps and after #### was professor of astronomy at brown university 
after her fathers death lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with winslow in washington dc  their house writes albert s flint was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer especially grateful to one like myself far from home 
moreover she had physical as well as mental vigor winslow as his daughters eleanor and margaret recall used to characterize her as our iron sister 
as a matter of fact albert s flint expressed his conviction that her physical strength her mental power her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country while in washington dc lucy upton held positions in the us census office and in the pension bureau 
after the months in europe she returned to boston and became active in church and community life what was called an accidental meeting with miss packard in washington turned her attention to spelman 
she served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students 
of her exquisiteness of dress her wellmodulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers her great love of flowers and plants and birds 
and as graduates gratefully recall she drew on her purse as well many a student was able to remain at spelman only because of her unobtrusive help 
after all she had come to spelman seminary in #### and had been since #### except for one year associate principal or dean she had taught classes in botany astronomy with the aid of a telescope geometry and psychology 
and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and christian zeal both loved the outofdoors including mountain climbing and horseback riding 
so strenuous it was physically with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both miss packard and miss upton at the fifteenth anniversary #### as already quoted miss upton projected with force and eloquence the spelman of the future as a college of first rank with expanding and unlimited horizons 
her services to the school for many years were of a very high character and i have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her such were the qualities of the actingpresident of the seminary after the death of miss giles 
she noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired 
there were thirtyeight patients on the bus the morning i left for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating an interne a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us 
it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to a hospital for the mentally ill i suddenly thought of mary jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses 
i had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in marshall field & co she knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies 
she wasnt quite sure that i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return to it once i was out and on my own again  i read those newspaper stories about you she had said 
 why do you say that  i was full of booze and well a drunk is apt to do anything he says hell do 
were you in love with that girl  would it make any difference to you if i were mary jane 
im interested in every patient ive helped take care of when i think of people like you well i 
 you are young intelligent have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference selfdestructive attitudes i dont blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you 
you dont believe that im going back to medical school and finish do you ive worked this ward for three months now 
they all mean well have great promises to make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness youve not seemed like them but maybe you are 
its not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to hanover i wanted to go to college too 
 thats what i mean about you anderson she said  you dont seem to know much about reality 
my fathers a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year there was no money for tuition for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted 
im going to become a good nurse and ive got two baby brothers that are going to have college if i have to work at my profession until im an old maid to give it to them  do you have a boy friend 
 what about your father and mother dont you think of them when youre in a place like this  my father and mother died when i was two years old i said 
i have no one but myself to worry about something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face 
her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts and uncles cousins listening i felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can 
ill bet he wouldnt be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date i mean after im out of the hospital a month or so from now  my father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to homicide for five years 
i dont think hed mind too much if he were sure youd decided not to be a rumdum in the future how would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date when i get through at hanover 
what about your that girl you were going to kill it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane brennan should know the truth about me that i was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be 
i can say this im dead serious about going back to school as for that other girl lets just say that i never want to see her again 
 yes ill get one overnight a month  well go up to the edgewater beach hotel for dinner i said 
there hadnt been anything really personal in her interest in me it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there 
it seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me only two people in the state of illinois knew that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name or why 
but i had the proof all documented in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free to do so as the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in order 
perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was delusion i had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic production called ask tony 
no one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue as a road company and eventually become a movie 
we opened on friday and closed the following monday out of the entire cast i alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer 
we were paid off tuesday morning and given tickets back to new york i felt lonely and depressed as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel 
i had been among the top third in my class at nyu had wanted desperately to go to medical school but id run out of money and energy at the same time then later i had quit my safe secure fiveaweek spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play 
i knew that id soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life 
when i answered it a voice too dignified and british to be real said is this mr dale nelson the actor  why dont you bastards lay off for a while 
im calling you mr nelson at the request of mr phillip wycoff could you possibly have lunch with him today 
 youll send the rollsroyce of course  yes of course mr nelson 
i finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of ask tony they all bowed low as i approached them 
i laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round he had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me 
i followed him out through the lobby to the street an ancient rollsroyce as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb 
i was giving the parked cars the onceover the oldsmobile with the license number jyj ### was in stall number five 
i walked with him back to the entrance he gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it 
he started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and said oh yes youre the one i was talking to about a monthly rental 
he consulted the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said youre in the third row back toward the rear can you find it all right 
i always keep a set in the car i put in new batteries so as to be certain id have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully 
one of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting for the first fifteen or twenty minutes its possible to be more or less interested in window displays then in people passing by 
your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary youre conscious of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard 
i wasnt far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car the attendant recognized me once more and said what did you do about that office 
i have a couple of them im figuring on one here and one thats out quite a ways where theres usually curb parking 
i kept trying to get him to take my money want me to drive it out 
 its one of the rules on transients  make it as snappy as you can will you 
you dont want to lease a place way out in the sticks you get business where the business is not where it isnt 
i hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn 
i turned on the electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear i made time and picked him up within ten blocks 
after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left i couldnt see him but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half beeps when the car i was following was to the left and long drawnout beeps when it turned to the right 
i turned left too soon and got a signal showing that i was still behind him but he was to the right after a while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me 
i found a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours 
i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasnt traffic my lights would have been a giveaway if id tried to shadow him in the conventional manner 
his signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz i circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a highclass restaurant 
i sat there with the faint odor of charcoalbroiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee my man came out an hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went to the swim and tan motel 
i remembered it was the peeping tom place i waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register 
i noticed that he was in unit ## and that he had registered under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco address he had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still good 
if he does its still better than an even chance he wont notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony numbers in between 
she was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasnt checking license numbers or bothering the tenants  you mean youre all alone mr richards 
 if you expect her to show up she said youd better put and wife on there  any difference in the rate 
there are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office there are three softdrink vending machines and if you should be joined by anybody try to keep things quiet if you will 
 thank you i told her i took another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the key to unit ## that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car 
i put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted to case with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound of water running 
i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed its one thing to go without food when youre occupied with some work or when youre simply postponing a meal but when youre dependent on someone else and know that you cant eat until hes bedded down for the night hunger can be a gnawing torture 
the batteries on the bugging device i had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals the powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry 
the place wasnt particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the tightestfitting pair of slacks i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was and there was lots of it wanted to be sociable  you really in a hurry handsome 
 its early in the evening to be in a hurry  there may not be any women left i said 
 ill be here at tenfiftyfive i said whats that thing going buzzbuzzbuzz in your car 
i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device she went in to get the hamburgers and i switched on the device again and kept the signal from dowlings car coming in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the hamburgers 
 dont you think its selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up shell eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and im to have one with her so she wont feel out of place 
 how much overweight is she  not a bit i said but shes keeping her figure in hand 
i turned on the device again half fearful that i might find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear when i switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the exact change plus a dollar tip 
the thin man said thataway  second building on the right 
 so even if we was as dumb as you take us for we could still find it roberta and dave began to back toward the door 
 it says water works but there is a policeman on duty too  a night policeman just like in the states 
at the door dave paused to feel for the latch he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him 
there was something phony about all this gun waving something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open 
it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top there was a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs 
ratface at the counter was on his feet the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles 
she sidled along the booths one step at a time as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to lauren 
the fat man removed his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his paunch the thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number 
he turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side 
she musta been walking in her sleep you seen her yourself in here  remember how she looked when barney held the door for her 
 stupid fools aint got enough brains between the two of you grosse muttered his head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket 
but he was aware of it just the same he knew vince steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be 
the heavy glass didnt break but the top flew off sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence 
 why does everything have to happen to me grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar 
once he said whyn hell didnt you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off dont you and barney ever use your brains 
he returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser  she dont know nothing about them cars 
 how do you know stupid  one word of this gets to guardino 
he ran a finger down his cheek tracing the scratch there  why cant i leave her locked up in the tool crib 
 you and barney get her over to roses before it gets too light after guardinos left well dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home 
 what am i going to do with her all day in the tool crib she cant get away 
just get her where guardino wont see her and start asking questions vince shouted finally get her over to roses and ill come by and see that she stays put 
i wish you luck when you try scaring that kid his voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled 
vince lifted his hand as if to strike but his thin lips spread in a smile  whered you say you was born 
and i aint going back there on account of one lousy kid lauren landis rubbed her face against the blanket 
she could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car she had figured that out but she couldnt understand their subsequent actions was it because she had shown panic 
she was glad the fat man had left she jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of coke 
he placed a bottle opener on the counter she blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle 
the man was busy doing something to the inside of the doorframe on the drivers side of a car he looked in her direction but he didnt answer 
he seemed to be looking at a point above the little window lauren said why cant i call my home 
i could send the money right back barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking 
he said i only work here but he was back at work on a car 
how could he be kind one moment and cruel the next did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her 
the unknown was so much worse than what dangers lay ahead for her what awful thing had she to face in the next few hours 
with a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in she would think about something else 
her fathers attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldnt deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the falls and took the river road to lasalle and finally turned in at their own driveway at ### heather heights then he would yawn and stretch and shout all out 
and what would her mother be doing right now her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next to her on the front seat 
roberta landis put her hand on her husbands arm as he slid in the drivers seat beside her somewhere birds were sweetly calling were answered 
i saw that womans apron behind the door there was a wet spot she couldnt have been gone long 
he inserted the car key in the lock she stammered you heard what he said about police 
dave said i got the message i can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner 
he said im not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard 
his eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey 
this was acey squire proprietor of the juke joint marty smiled at squire pleasantly and said there was a cab waiting for me here 
squire chewed his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him looked into their staring eyes 
he avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him  i have to get back to jarrodsville he went on 
i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town id be happy to pay for the favor of course 
it was so utterly unexpected that marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened there was no word spoken no apparent signal given 
they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward jarrodsville 
in seconds all four cars were out of sight marty land stood alone on a redclay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again 
he thought he saw a pale face at a window perhaps she would be glad that they hadnt hurt him 
there was another on this side a little further down there were many more between here and jarrodsville 
there was nothing he could do but walk and jarrodsville was more than three miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire 
after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mudcaked the viscous mud was ankledeep and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light 
there were several people on the porch of the farmhouse there was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teenagers 
perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town then he realized the utter futility of the idea 
even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious on his side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning against a plow 
he remembered a story he had read as a youth it was probably one of kiplings tales of the british army 
the steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man aboutfaced and turned his back as the officer approached marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs 
the days rain had been added to the stagnant water he was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car 
it was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road 
the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him beside a fenced field a second car was coming from the west from the direction of sanfords run 
it was a narrow road barely wide enough for two cars to pass he could not leave the road because of the waterfilled drainage ditch 
there was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy water 
marty knew how the union soldiers must have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they called the rebel yell for moments he stood in water shivering and gasping for breath 
the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared in the distance there had been two more cars parked at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck 
and then the station wagon and the ford would seek him out again he would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville 
that way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbedwire fence he had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse 
the admassy place could not be far now he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest 
he did not dare climb back up to the road he was deep in water but at least they could not reach him there 
he climbed back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted he stood panting for a moment 
the fence his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it he lurched on down the road despairingly because there was no place else to go 
probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse too but he did not bother to look he broke into a dogtrot breathing heavily streaming with sweat 
the plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant 
he stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect target the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards 
he held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible when the plymouth neared it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down 
he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side 
he did not leave the middle of the road he trudged on his aching eyes focused straight ahead 
and then he heard a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and weep  oh no not again he said aloud 
now he saw that the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms frantically it was the prowl car from the sheriffs office 
 get in charley estes said brusquely he staggered into the back seat and lay back fighting for breath 
pete turned around and said to marty i guess you think im a yellowbellied hound but there wasnt no use in me staying there 
if id stayed all that id have got was four punctured tires and one busted head why didnt you wait at the burch house 
i was lucky they let me go i guess the sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space 
every man in every one of these houses is a night rider then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes 
he listened a moment and then said hold it he turned his head and said alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour 
that wasnt too far from fifth street and should allow him to make scottys bar by midnight he said with satisfaction thats fine tim 
 i dont know what youre getting into mike he said unhappily shayne said briskly grab another drink if you want it 
have you got my car here rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of halfmelted icecubes 
i can drop you back here to pick mine up he went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door 
that is maybe not too much of a lady at least i want to find out whether shes home yet or not 
in rourkes car shayne drove east to biscayne boulevard and north toward felice perrins address which had been given to him by the peralta governess as he drove he filled in timothy rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises 
 i dont know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but i want to see who takes the call  this deal at las putas buenas where the two knifemen jumped you said rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious mrs peralta doesnt it 
 that story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony if it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written before peralta ever called me in on the case 
i think her husband strongly suspects so and thats why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign 
turn to the left i think for that number you gave me not more than a block or so 
there was a small neonlighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palmlined street where most of the houses on both sides were older twostory mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers 
shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied he turned to see the brieflyillumed faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke said its the next house mike 
he went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor  i told you mike said rourke in an aggrieved voice 
 did you see the car parked across the street  it has a beach license tim 
unless im crazy as hell theyre two of painters dicks those names mean anything to you 
 what are they doing here maybe with specific orders to see that i dont make contact with her 
you drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there youre a reporter and youre looking for miss perrin to interview her 
theyve got no official standing on this side of the bay as soon as you find out if they are geely and harris come on around to the lounge where ill be waiting 
timothy rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel  the things you talk me into mike 
he crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant he was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came in six or eight minutes later 
shayne told the bartender bourbon and water and rourke told him its those two all right i made them show me their identification before i could be persuaded not to call on felice perrin 
in exactly three minutes go in that phone booth behind you and call police headquarters just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car 
the bartender brought rourkes drink and shayne laid a twentydollar bill on the bar he said in a low voice ive got a date with a lady mister 
you know how it is he added with a conspiratorial wink  candy is dandy but liquor is quicker and you dont have any candy for sale here anyhow 
he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what in hell are you going to do mike 
shayne strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south 
he hoped he wouldnt be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but its weight was comforting at his hip on this side of the bay miami beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and shaynes pistol permit was just as good as theirs 
he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the righthand side the big paunchy man named geely was on that side halfturned in the seat toward his hatchetfaced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door 
geely grunted and slid partly out and shaynes left arm snaked in around his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big gumchewing jaw before geely could straighten up shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster somewhat impeded by the steering wheel 
he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp he dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from geelys recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side 
he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat he turned then to look toward the lighted boulevard and saw rourkes tall emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side 
said theyd have a patrol car here fast  why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold shayne said goodhumoredly 
got no business over here on a stakeout anyway they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling 
the stairway on the right was dark but there was a wallswitch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top and they went up there were two front rooms both dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake 
mickey paused with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out do a little planning he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set 
i wouldnt have to tell them i had roberts then he heard it like a muffled thud felt a subtle change in air pressure 
mickey tried to flatten against the banister gripped it with one hand but roberts full weight struck him at that moment in the groin he gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail 
by a wrenching effort he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head he was fuzzy in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of the weight of roberts body 
mickey was on his knees when roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand he felt his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand 
he rose stiffly forcing his knees to lock the knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again 
the pain dulled as he moved and he steadied inside after a moment he extended one hand the fingers curled 
roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps he held the razor well out to one side 
they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared the last step  any time roberts he said 
he advanced slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side he was just short of arms reach when he stopped 
there was a fixed grin on roberts face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along 
mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door this was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern 
mickeys guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon it moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward 
before roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into roberts belly ducking mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood floor 
he felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs he got a knee up into roberts belly used both hands and heaved him clear then scrambled to his feet 
still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking his head he hit roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled in midair 
roberts careened backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs the sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate suddenend sound 
mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands panting for breath after a minute he went to roberts looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse 
it seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this 
the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that by then they could never catch up with the others 
one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet he climbed the stairs went into roberts room found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could 
when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched he went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat 
he set roberts suitcase near the front door went outside and walked back to the garage he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing 
he could feel it on his face and in his hair he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed it up for five minutes 
he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping 
the body was heavier than he had anticipated he got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the jeep 
he drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier it snowed continuously but quietly evenly 
the jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground he drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine 
he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it 
inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden by the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight 
there was too much weight casually to toss it away he could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out 
it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but roberts had asked for it it was too late to worry about that 
it was a relief to get rid of the weight he was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down 
it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off he gave it a strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole 
the body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor there was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter 
it wasnt cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact he made his way back to the jeep 
he climbed down went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit it landed on roberts sprawled right thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground 
in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had made of it there were stains here and there and he cleaned them off using an oiled rag he found on a nail 
he replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it out of the garage there were tire marks where it had been but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny 
he judged her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently had run away 
the maid answered and he decided nancy must be at work jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly but it does sound good 
that courtyard picture with the same initials  im not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm 
on the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast gulf springs was ten miles inland more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions 
the courthouse was a whitestucco building minus the customary dome instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most smalltown squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably brightgreen shade of florists grass 
a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office seated in front of the desk hank said im looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff 
 so youre looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned if there was such a person im afraid she got away with it 
itll be a tedious job but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisors office  maybe the society editor would remember a goodlooking outoftown bride 
the editor says that marriages may be made in heaven but weddings are made in mrs calhouns columns shes the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday paper and all that 
shed be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background shed have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment 
 i wish you good luck but please dont dig up too tough a case for me this close to election if you find out anything come on back here and well get started on it 
it turned out that she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance the wearying trek stretched into the afternoon from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found her at five oclock 
it took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted i remember her because she didnt want her picture in the paper 
 what reason did she give  said she had a breakingout on her face some sort of allergy and none of her old pictures was good enough 
but of course you couldnt see too well through the veil  was her name lisa carmody 
 i think they moved away shortly after they were married he was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred 
 have they inherited some money or something she asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye 
he hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving  sounds like what youre after he said when hank had finished 
in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolledup shirt sleeves  mr ferrell hirey lindsay chairman of the board of supervisors 
wants to look up something in the newspaper files so dont lock him in here it latches when you close it so stay as long as you like 
before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners 
he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leatherbound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls a metal table and four chairs stood in the center 
 its all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave and of course you know not to take clippings 
 dont forget to turn it off and close the door good so itll latch hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules 
in a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room an old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him 
but he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones last years volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling 
he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it he staggered over and dropped it on the table 
he tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him at last he found it in the paper of april # 
there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom mr blacks life was an open book so to speak from his birth in jackson mississippi through his basketballplaying days at lsu and his attainment of a ba degree which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for peerless business machines 
hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for mr black if mrs black was who he thought she was mr blacks peerless selling days might well be over 
he found it in the edition of may ## the item said mr and mrs black had moved to jackson his home town so the lovely lisa had been with him a year ago 
he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to indulge his weakness now for the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen mckinleys assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago and the hallmills trial 
he turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence 
he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing it clanged shut as he sprang toward it 
 hey come back he shouted he thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up 
unless he was stoneblind the person whod just left couldnt have missed seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room and even if hed somehow missed seeing him he wouldnt have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room 
to search his room at the motel to come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left 
nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault then he heard it and smelled it the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping 
until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality 
they kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide  i take a little time to think it over 
 time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at mr skyros  not too much time because ill be needing some more myself pretty much right away 
i dont want no trouble you dont want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr skyros dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another man came in 
the genial smile seemed painted on his face angie knew speak of dangerous information 
and cant say i blame you said angie thoughtfully  this deal with the ace o spades 
ace of spades a widow that was what they called a widow these lowclass crooks remembered mr skyros distractedly when things got a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand it seemed to be a general rule 
mr skyros did not at all like the look on angelos regularfeatured almost girlishly goodlooking face or indeed anything about angelo mr skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles 
 look my friend he said in my life i learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure i stay in business so long because im careful 
 thats a long while said angie  i tell you you want to leave it that way i dont fool around with it 
and mr skyros didnt like angie but what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys why did everything have to happen at once denny said stupidly why you aint turning angie down are you mr skyros 
 mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me he said  its ok denny everythings ok aint it mr skyros 
but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held you could say the whip hand if mr skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause 
who knew angie might not last long the sweat broke out on mr skyros forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking hoping planning perhaps 
 now you dont want to go talking that way he said  sure sure youre the one take over for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isnt it 
i dont know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but ill try my best my friend you see you got to remember we all got schedules like any business 
its awkward you see that isnt it  well thats your business mr skyros said angie and his dreamy eyes moved past mr skyros shoulder to gaze vaguely out the groundglass window 
we dont none of us want no trouble im in a room over the golden club on san pedro you just ask for me there you want see me 
about nine oclock i call and see if you got any a couple decks for me mr skyros and tentwelve to sell see i like to have a little ready cash 
 and you know angelo pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they say fifty a throw that the deal 
never mind how much i cut it how much i get and he smiled his sleepy smile again you go n have a look round for it 
this is awkward for everybody isnt it we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes but i do my best for you 
the expedient thing yes very true one must make do as one could in some situations not very much later but when things had settled down a little 
he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed he rather wished he had never got into the business and still scarcely to be resisted a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money
she did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks usually she marked the few who did thank you you didnt get that kind much in a place like this and she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she could act to the others before theyd take offense threaten to call the manager 
the kind who came into a cheap store like this grab snatch i saw that first 
shed be through here just no time at all leave this kind of thing way behind off at noon and shed never come back 
shed be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills sos nobody would suspect maybe couldnt get it until monday account of that the banks but that wasnt really long to wait no need say anything at all to the old woman 
shed say she didnt feel good on sunday couldnt go to church thered be a little argument but she could be stubborn and when the old woman had gone quick pack the things shed need to take all but the dress shed wear monday and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for a dime then on monday morning or it might have to be tuesday get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old womans purse there in the drawer 
no need leave a note with it either or maybe just something like dont worry about me im going away to make a better life she didnt mind working hard not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft all she wanted was a chance where she wasnt marked as what she was 
prettier shed do her hair another way smarter and wear different kinds of clothes shed be katharine ross just what that sounded like 
katya made up the amount in indifferent silence she was listening to other voices out of the future 
oh katharines awfully nice and pretty too i like katharine lets ask katharine to go with us shes always lots of fun katharine it was going to be another hot day 
he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home after hed got out fresh liver for bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish 
he seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens  a lot of people are so peculiar that they dont like cats its not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens and damn it you know very well if i have them around long impossible to give them away 
yes well its a pity to spoil your girlish figure which all those kittens would do anyway but i think when youve raised these well just have the vet fix it so there wont be any more i wonder if the carters would take one 
 happened to be in the hall happened to hear you quarrel about her 
but she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door miss celies taken to her bed with the door locked 
here she thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into sarahs hand  not that theres much use in locking up the smokehouse and the storehouse now 
 i dont want it sarah said firmly well ill take it down with me as i go 
at the door she turned back her roman nose looking very long now and satiric its just like that book your northern friend wrote except there arent any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds 
its silly childish running after them like that but of course the paterollers wont be of any help not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around god knows where 
but then the socalled coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable especially that cup she was deeply horribly sure that lucien had filled it with opium 
she felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time now wait a minute she told herself think about it 
she had lost a bottle of opium but that was on the trip from new orleans or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa 
rilly or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing back her washed clothes so somebody else could have come in too then or later while she was out of the room 
it was not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her he didnt even know that she was there 
no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised dont question rev had said dont invite danger 
sarah had begun to tell lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall so lolotte or anybody could have listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium 
she began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup so suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa 
it was merely an attempt to frighten her she wouldnt go back to new york as maude suggested 
she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life but before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken 
rev didnt need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out he could conceivably have wished to make sure 
rev would never have tried to give her poison she thrust the envelope back in the bag 
and in all likelihood by now there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract there was no point either in telling herself again what a fool shed been 
 too much work this morning miss sarah everybody gone like that sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat 
she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice 
 weve got to eat sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again the rice wasnt dosed with opium indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt 
in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking chickens  get a basket sarah told her 
sarah found the right key and unlocked the door it was a long low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines had run rampant over that too 
the shelves looked emptier than when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from the commissary had called there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with 
 cant you possibly imagine what life is going to be like here she sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden 
maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from sarahs room maude had the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she made up her mind to do 
she couldnt see any reason why maude would attempt to frighten her besides there was something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her 
yet maude had suggested that sarah return to new york maude could have shot emile if shed had a reason to kill him 
she started back for the house saw a light in the office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder rev george and lolotte were mending shoes 
they were all three bent over a shabby riding boot lolotte held a patch of leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for georges poised hammer 
 with boots on lolotte laughed softly there was no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at sarahs appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless and just possibly dead 
and what news sarah thought as satirically as maude might have said it revs face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning 
george poised with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt at murder i mean ive got to to see to the kitchen 
she thought as warm drizzling rain touched her face she was no schoolgirl refusing to bear tales 
if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien her husband it might be indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love but it was marriage 
always provided that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude was cleaning lamp chimneys 
again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her or to murder her the homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency 
she eyed the chickens with if she had known it something of glendoras dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin verbs i didnt think there was any reason to 
try to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with women you might try looking into his wife too 
 you think blacks the one were looking for i think he might be conrad said grimly 
 will you be coming back soon im on my way to see the jacobs woman 
i just dont want to go off halfcocked before picking up black thats all  gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday 
 arent you ever going to go home  it sure as hell doesnt look like it does it 
 remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet conrad hung up and sat on the small telephonebooth bench massaging his right leg 
thirty years experience let him know even at this early stage that black was his man it was a cold windy day the day after kittis death but stanley gilborn paid no attention to the blustery october wind 
he simply walked not noticing where he was not caring he stopped automatically at the street corners waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his coat open and flapping 
mainly of what conrad had tried to make him believe it was a succession of pictureimages passing through his mind the same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession 
conrads words had intellectual meaning for him only emotionally they penetrated him not at all 
he knew conrad had told him the truth it wasnt so because it couldnt be so 
she was the sun he the closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed for fiftyfive years he had lived progressing towards a nogoal eating working breathing without plan without reason 
he had lived all his life waiting for her not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered the possibility not once not for one onethousandth of a second of her infidelity 
the doorman began to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what had happened to him the night before he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts 
there was no evidence that anything was different than it had been without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door 
he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed him she was all he had everything he had everything he wanted 
where there is a victim there is a killer whoever he was and your wife were intimate 
the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain gilborn wondered whether kitti had lain in that same bed with who 
at the end of the halfhour racking his brains thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he left the bedroom before leaving he took one last lingering look at the apartment 
in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley gilborn was a lone figure on blanche jacobs kitti gilborns death had a quite different effect 
in blanches defense it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope if anyone had asked her she would have described herself only as nervous and worried 
she wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out 
men she reflected even men like stanley are unpredictable she tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they werent so many after all 
he had taken her upstairs to say good night it was in the kitchen as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that he had grabbed for her 
from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldnt breathe later she apologized for the long scratch across his face tried to explain she couldnt help herself that the panic arose in her unwanted 
she could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she first met him the morning he walked in to announce to her blushing that he was married 
blanche couldnt remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion she thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for stanley 
her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughters future but blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mothers continued carping had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony 
it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in taking such a momentous step stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman 
but one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world a woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband 
and then unexpectedly stanley made his announcement on that first day blanche literally thought she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind 
kitti was thirty years younger than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any right to hope for much less expect kitti could have married a score of men 
kitti had come into the office on somebodys recommendation because she needed help in preparing her income tax return stanley had filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting her to accept 
stanley had gone out saying he would be back in an hour after that day blanche still didnt know exactly what had happened 
blanche knew something must be causing stanleys new strange behavior but she never once connected it with kitti walker then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office stanley announced he and kitti were married 
that night the two of them left for a weeks honeymoon in acapulco while they were away blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically out of habit 
on the morning of stanleys return however her strength left her two hours of watching his serenely happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures and blanche had to leave 
she didnt tell anyone even her mother what was wrong she refused to have a doctor insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her 
 also if youre going to believe those prints youll have to look for a killer whos a topgrade piano player he demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack 
his hands snatched at an imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball thats been bounced hard in the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that 
if rose mallorys killer acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch wed know him by his stretch pants and the flowers hed wear twined in his hair 
this you will remember was still new years day by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous nights noisemakers and paper hats 
that incidentally might give you some idea of what felix was like after all he hadnt happened upon us in that secondfloor hall without warning 
the meat wagon therefore was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings there was furthermore the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance 
youve been away from home for the new year festivities but now the party is over and you come home defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober 
its not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr average citizen you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants 
can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door 
instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs  got the upstairs guy he bellows 
even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable official control could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand what im getting at is that we were fully prepared for felixs being an odd one 
we were not however prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came up the stairs he of course must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling 
he came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance he adjusted the hat lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him 
felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably homegrown 
his hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck he had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short 
for a man of his mass he was curiously short he wasnt a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure 
for felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement the man was just this side of being a freak 
he was dressed in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor mans country weekend dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel shirt black silk necktie 
 that much latin we remember gibby said dryly  you always live up to your name always like this always making happy 
 the world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene ive never noticed that it improves things any 
 whats the rest of your name  the past i leave to historians felix intoned demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy 
 in the present felix proclaimed is there any other time in which a man can live 
could your future your immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him your finger tips the happy one could never have looked happier 
he was prancing along the hall heading for the next flight of stairs  were here because of what happened last night he said 
 i cant see what would make it necessary for you to know nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world 
having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible this was a broth of a boy our felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit 
you may think we didnt need nancy and jean but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldnt be useful before we were through with this case also if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood 
if you can possibly avoid it you dont hand out any extra chances it was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope 
when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night he quickly fixed that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others 
there was no process of trial and error starting with the room completely blacked out as it was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare 
there was no display of either works in progress or of finished work here and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it 
the equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workmans comfort convenience and efficiency 
supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins andy did not see the newspapers the next day 
he finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used and didnt awaken until early afternoon memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach 
presumably the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped him it was still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary 
he was dozing perhaps the only sleep hed gotten lot of people waiting to see you though 
hows lissa do you know shes got plenty of guts mr paxton 
hub shook his head so andy told him not to bother the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort or to be comforted 
they had nothing to give to each other the omission might look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances 
as the afternoon sped toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each with his own special problem they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations 
raymond fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas engagement they decided it was wise and later to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casinos open date 
he asked if there was anything he could do andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute arrangements 
hub nosing about spotted reporters in the lobby so andy was hustled away quietly through the hotels service entrance in a strange car which hub had procured somewhere they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub 
long before he reached the protection of the stage door andy was recognized word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire 
it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the difference from last nights heroworshippers they had come not to admire but to observe 
 skolmans jammed in every table he could find under the heading of its an ill wind et cetera 
but in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read were with you all the way it was signed by everyone in the troupe 
bake was waiting to report that lou duvol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment 
andy told him bake i wish youd talk to skolman see if some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside its just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasnt able to get a table 
skolman isnt going to like it much though giving away what he should be selling skolman wasnt the only one who didnt care for andys scheme 
 i got a bone to pick with you mr paxton andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying 
my men have been here all afternoon setting up for this thing bonner explained that with the nightclubs cooperation the police had occupied el dorado like a battlefield 
however it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower available for the purpose  i want you to have the speakers taken out 
didnt they tell you what i wanted the p a system for what do you expect to get tonight anyway 
or have a sign on his car that says here comes the paxton kidnapper  i cant stop you from doing what you think is right 
 someday bonner said youre going to ask us for help  what you dont understand is that im asking for it now 
he had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination he had to cling to routine tested procedures 
but admit or not bonner was helpless the crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist 
bake and shirl winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any clearcut information regarding his efforts  the sweaty bastards probably halfway to peru with our money by now 
thornburg popped in to advise andy skolmans sending up smoke signals  theyre drinking arent they 
i guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything thornburg added in a lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an audience 
hub you stick by the stage door if rock shows up during the number or you hear anything give me the signal 
theres a couple of callbacks i can work on  youre a sweetheart but leave one line open 
it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it the act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone 
but this was no ordinary show and andy knew it whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it 
twentyfour hours had changed him from a performer to a freak within this framework what followed was strained even macabre 
the effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause irresolute and shortlived yet andy plowed ahead mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners warmed to him 
as andy reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings rocco vecchio a perspiring haggard vecchio was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards 
andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction 
ray if you please the cradle song he sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience 
having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone for support for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest 
but when he was finally through their scorn was made apparent as the lights came up andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit 
at this moment all he could think of was what hed been forced to undergo do you know what they think of me 
 sure andy itll be all right thornburg knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile as humpty dumpty 
god knows how but i got it youll never believe the places ive been today 
he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent 
andy had no desire to linger himself but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of sight then hurried after 
old man arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door just dont tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours 
under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory  the bartlett girl was killed by mr dronks son 
theyve found some sort of new evidence a bundle of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime the two kids were together a lot they were having some kind of teenage affair god knows how far that had gone and the kids crippled 
my god how much more do you want you should have gone to work today stead of sneaking around spying on the dronk house 
young mrs arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits the old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight 
 they found something else up there she said halfaloud to the empty room  they took it away overalls or something 
 now theyve gone they didnt come back and they didnt arrest that dronk boy she was wearing a brown cotton dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below 
 why on earth did i send him off to work there was excuse enough to keep him home that young mr arthurs still over there 
 i think you had better come home mr crossons been on everybodys neck an order he expected didnt come through and hes 
i need someone to go out and find out whats happening  but i couldnt do that even if i were home 
he couldnt see the grin that split her mouth the teeth that shone into the phone were like a sharks 
id think that you even more than i would be wondering what theyre up to they found some clothes she tossed in 
i guess he wants to ask you some questions  then id better wait until five 
in his office mr holden replaced the phone slowly he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face 
for a moment he thought of going into crossons office to explain that he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a pounding in his head that he decided to let it go he passed the receptionist in the outer office muttering ive got to go out for a little while 
putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body once out in the street the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken 
what on earth was in maes mind that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing what did she think he could do 
she wanted the police to notice him suspect him she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions 
theyd have some suspicions to repeat to the police though his inner thoughts cringed at it he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child 
a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as mae had clicked on the light suppose the cops somehow got hold of that 
and when he came to examine the scene there was a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift suspicion darted into his mind mae wouldnt have plotted a thing like that 
he leaned on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring order into his thoughts there was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare 
even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake to head up the road for home doing her bidding he drove and the road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side 
he had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide there was really no place to go finally except home to mae 
cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just standing there morosely behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man arthur 
he could tell them his fears of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his own jerkings and snivelings and fergusons silent patience he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department 
once he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense there wouldnt be very much for mae to do at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about 
why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight ill bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be theyve worried theyve lain awake nights theyve shook at the slightest footstep theyve pictured their own destruction and now its all over and they can give up 
holden waved a hand at the empty street he drove into the paved space before the garage and got out slamming the car door 
he went to the front door and opened it and looked in mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen 
she stood there watching holden come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth  ive been thinking she said swallowing the toast 
you used them that time you painted the porch at our other house and then you wiped up some grease 
 ive been looking for them and theyre gone im sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago 
 i dont remember any overalls at all well im not sure of the color 
holden noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck  my goodness you ought to remember if i do 
tell them the truth or something before they come here his nerves seemed frostbitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glasslike liable to break like an icicle at any moment 
or are the eyebrows more like this when he had finished with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else most probably a busboy 
men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once more 
at the hotel dumont there had at the time in issue been twentythree overnighters counting couples as singular these included as one mr and mrs anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before and had not checked out together 
there was of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel the twentythree or twentytwo with the paynes themselves omitted provided merely a place to start and their identification was the barest of starts 
it would almost inevitably trouble some water  i certainly was not at the dumont last night and my husband couldnt have been 
the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didnt want heaven knew didnt want  to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations to distant homes probably through rain or in november something worse 
the king arthur had fiftyfour overnighters again counting rooms rather than people failing to find what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special but not exclusive attention to those with rooms on the street 
 and know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel it was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel 
it is dull business detecting and hard on feet there was also the one salient question to ask and ask widely did you notice anything out of the way 
there was of course no hope it really would be that simple the sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune 
or long fat suitcase for that matter shrugs met that from room clerks from bellhops 
cases say for musical instruments  detective pearson eighteenth precinct thought for a time he might be on to something 
well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with an ocelot at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair 
there had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because he kept jerking his head as reports dribbled in william weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head 
the house was modern large on five acres the state cops would check from time to time 
only those actually with payne when he was shot or who had left the party within not more than five minutes make five arbitrary positively had none they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore have shot him from above 
intangibles entered then hunches which felt like facts willings was presumably a better than average shot 
because if for no other reason willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything else that went on two legs ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a tiger 
no motive is a part of fact nobody in his right mind punishes a quartercenturyold dereliction 
faith constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong 
she had left the party early pleading a headache no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun 
 she might now have taken it away again heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too 
 there was nothing to indicate that lauren payne was primitive she was young but not that young 
he reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative he also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities 
here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years but bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode 
seeing the man he blamed for this made much of youth and bitterness and  send out a pickup on mrs mason and the boy when youve got enough to go on bill said 
he would say of course that he had not really had any such wish that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing 
which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say a man named blaine smythe with y and e but pronounced without them had been fired at paynes insistence 
would certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder he would have to be given the opportunity 
it was evident that a captain should remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat bill weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster 
stilts and shadow on pams bed appeared to be one cat rather large as siamese cats go and to be sure having two heads and two tails on the other hand they or it seemed to have no legs whatever 
of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this but at this the one toolarge cat suddenly became two cats stretching 
stilts a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her 
it was not whatever tale was told by tails it was most unlikely that she would be firm 
after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible 
that was more like a thought but not a great deal more had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear 
some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of it pam realized to her surprise that she had been almost dozing 
even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the voice  i said i would pam said 
 call this a cry for help faith constable said  through a door conveniently unlocked madden supplemented 
 a gift horse to be viewed with suspicion  if there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later 
much better to break a cellar window  dont forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling reminded him 
and a pane of glass isnt hard to he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson 
with his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying uhhuh and i see at intervals at last he said well thank you for calling mr benson 
 coroner he said to madden  hes just heard from the pathologist who says mrs meeker apparently died from suffocation 
particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities 
no signs of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach the duration of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mrs meeker died several hours after her sevenoclock dinner 
 so there it is he said  not your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one and the same 
he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light madden with his investigation centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the bronx bank through which mrs meekers checks to johnston had cleared 
he might have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud he might be mrs meekers murderer or have played some part in her death 
if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he too had another identity no one the medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about johnston 
then he asked to use the phone and called brian thayer who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two oclock madden said that he would see him at two and made another call this one to mrs meekers lawyers 
the secretarys tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which madden should be duly grateful he inferred that hohlbein and garth were highpriced lawyers 
he disliked garth on sight conservative clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions 
that there were three children two boys and a girl that she was active in the womans club and he in lions rotary and jaycee 
madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it 
he asked to see a copy of mrs meekers will the date october # #### immediately caught the inspectors eye 
she had reason to change the one she made right after mr meekers death she wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most 
 mr hohlbein and i have noticed some lapses since though most of them this past year id say 
she always did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised mrs meeker hadnt struck him as ready to seek anyones advice least of all garths 
it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs he skimmed over the millions that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing when he came to the scholarship fund 
a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected he went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him 
to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars to the pecks ten thousand each 
 no additional five thousand for each year after joans twentyfirst birthday mrs meeker hadnt got around to taking care of that 
arthur williamss might well have been included he felt mrs meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers 
 this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more  well she had a number of them where money was concerned garth said 
the next moment shed put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston affair there was no telling how shed react to spending money 
there was an annual audit garth informed him no discrepancies or shortages had ever been found 
his salary had reached the ten thousand mark his expenses ran another four or five thousand 
but he didnt play golf didnt seem to belong to any local clubs his work took him away a lot of course which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself garths glance began to flicker to his watch 
he would offer no theory to account for her murder the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug 
even so maddens dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened it would be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud with its probable byproduct of murder led to garths door 
but for all his air of affluence who could tell what his private financial picture was the inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking 
he lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district he occupied a twobedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second bedroom as his office 
done by a professional decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month 
he took madden into the room he used as an office it contained a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs 
thayer folded it up and offered a drink to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston 
for all her domineering ways i cant conceive of her having had a deadly enemy  dammit phil are you trying to wreck my career 
griffith had confronted hoag on the buildings front steps hoag had been permitted no further and backed him against a wroughtiron railing his rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed 
 phil for gods sake go away i told you theres nothing between midge and me nothing 
 why im not fit to touch the hem of her garment  leigh get a grip on yourself 
griffith looked at him suspiciously through redrimmed eyes you wouldnt pull my leg old man 
 no use he wont come he peered closely at hoag in the gathering darkness 
 he says im to take the message  whod hit you in the head 
tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it 
mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now  whered you expect the john 
they wont even let you in the front door so why dont you be a good boy and 
 and you know i can do it he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back 
he took several large swallows recollected that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him the way hoag was no telling what he might say or do 
at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress  yes what is it 
docherty said its okay bonfiglio let him by griffith said hoag told me to tell you he waited until they were close 
 he claims mahzeers in a plot to kill the pm docherty went taut was it possible 
the prime minister knew who his enemy was here he wasnt going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter 
docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck one more muddleheaded play like that one and theyd be leading him away 
 whered your friend hoag get his information  would you mind sending him up here 
but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building he was unwilling to rely on griffiths carrying his message and he had no confidence the police would act on it 
he would have to do something on his own the door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs 
in half an hour the reception would be over if mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes 
wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories on the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests 
it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible he and the prime minister would be back from the window seated at mahzeers desk 
in a minute or five minutes the business would be done mahzeer would stand up the prime minister would follow 
hoag would carry its sound to his grave mahzeer of course would be desolate 
where was muller waiting with the rifle narrow fourstory buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf 
the legation was generously set back from the building line if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere 
he ran his eye along the roof copings but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman 
hoag crossed the narrow street squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk from this side he could see farther into the legations thirdstory window but he saw no faces 
he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades one was a club that was out two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted 
he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence 
he went on to the next building and found what he expected the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes 
this was senseless he had no idea what to look for all were empty except one and that one was jammed with letters and magazines 
muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes the cooking odors were stronger all over the city at this hour housewives would be fussing over stoves 
he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead now he was certain the lock had not yielded to mullers collection of keys 
it had been shut again but the lock was broken he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch 
he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldnt find him that muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond hoags control he could not break in on an armed man 
his thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door hoag pushed open the door at the far end of the long dark room muller was faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised 
he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoags apartment hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch evil flourishes in the dark 
muller nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a cars headlights threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain 
he was dead before his body made contact with the floor hoag stumbled back into the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch 
the safe at ingleside district station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain harriss office to the left the lieutenants office farther along and to the left and the janitors supply closet straight ahead the safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred and fifty unused lefthand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemens ball tickets from last year and thirtyseven cents in coins and stamps 
it was more a matter of tact and also it was none of killpaths goddam business he walked up to the lieutenants office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range 
the clerk wagged his head toward the captains office gun went to the connecting door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair 
the lieutenant eyed guns reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his head fight with sam schaeffer fight with the whole damned bureau 
if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant killpath peered through halfclosed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and aboutfaced 
he sat stiffbacked in a chair that did not swivel though it was obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair the desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons 
it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer he put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant 
finally orville intoned through his hawk nose we cant have people running in any time they please sergeant he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach his beady eyes fixed on matson 
killpath said you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago sergeant thats not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it 
the daywatch platoon commander lt rinker was calling out the beat assignments but matson couldnt make the names mean anything  i called the station at three this morning killpaths nasal voice pronounced 
 now now youre just guessing sergeant  what if i said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen 
 he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper now thats not regulation is it 
his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now  thats not taking ones command with a responsible attitude matson 
but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank  i was out in the district sir 
 i might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped he took up a white sheet of paper dark with singlespaced data 
gun knew it was car ## the wagon returned from delivering inglesides drunkanddisorderlies to the city jail but for some fool reason he couldnt remember which men hed put on the transfer detail 
what have you to say to that sergeant killpath sailed the paper across the desk but matson didnt pick it up or even glance at it 
 patrolman accacia is an alert and conscientious lawenforcement officer i dont think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson 
i would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot if id sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district its too bad i didnt call you and its too bad i let schaeffer use accacia when he could have had a boy whod be glad to learn something of homicide procedure 
 lets not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath nasaled  i shouldnt like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty 
he clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out an argument with orville torrence killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range 
 lets just remember sergeant that we must all carry our own umbrella a district station cant run smoothly unless he interrupted himself looking around gun at the doorway 
 ive been here for some time he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun coldly 
it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in killpaths office now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping to hear the daywatch playback of his chewing out 
he just didnt want to talk about it if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour 
at the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes remembering then that hed left them at the doughnuttery he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home 
it was nine oclock in the morning the hour which like a spade turning clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night mission street at this hour was populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his tour of duty the neighborhood that had known urbano quintana by day 
it was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foothigh letters across each of the two display windows on the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez prop and under that se habla espanol 
mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission street aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising mr phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun matson who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a jiffycouchabed mauve velour $#### nothingdown special 
you cant tell a customer how much its going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down a time plan is a mere convenience you understand and when he interrupted himself smiling 
 why dont you just hire somebody else  she says she has to finish a story 
casey made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man his name was george needham and he too had come from a good family 
he was always well groomed and well tailored and he had that rich mans look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university an only child he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father doublecrossed him by dying broke 
all this went through caseys mind in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all for he had understood that betty had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins 
he wanted to ask her about jenkins now but he knew he couldnt do so in needhams presence and so still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding 
 oh ive known him quite a while  ive been after her for years needham said but ive never been able to get anywhere until the last few days 
 can i tell you a secret casey kept his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than the girl 
none of this showed in his face and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand he made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond fatherconfessor 
 you wouldnt want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would you she made a face at him and then she laughed 
 stop by any time casey he stood up and touched the girls arm 
casey watched them go still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check as he went out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat and coat from nancy parks and put a fiftycent piece in the slot he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry 
because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burtons car was still there in fact he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him 
even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it then he was striding across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note 
the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened the discarded papers inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct 
for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself for another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself 
it no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket 
he considered them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution he said the crazy fool half aloud 
he thought where the hell could he have gone there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control 
maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough he thought of other possibilities none of them satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton 
casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head when he heard calenda say what about that picture you took this afternoon 
 you took a picture of me at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand 
 who says its going to be published  i wouldnt even want it to get around 
even so he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly right now however he was still too worried about jerry burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told him to care too much about tony calenda 
 i was hired to take a picture thats all i know about it and thats all i care 
 all right calenda said his voice still quiet  but i meant what i said casey 
 you do that casey said  just be sure to send your two best boys tony 
as soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burtons home number he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up 
when he was told that no one had seen burton since then he thought of three other places that were possibilities each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up 
he had done all he could and that was that and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk 
he should have stayed here and watched burton he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink 
he considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes 
when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent you dont know me but i know you 
if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision 
some of them came from people who identified themselves some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past 
a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time 
it was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes he did not bother with his radio there would be time for that later but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned 
slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart  were out just a little too far 
poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw elaine  will you drop the anchor 
the rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the aj  reverse elaine said then peered through the loop of the rdf and waved to poet 
she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor 
the price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously nick wondered if elaine had bought them but he said nothing 
it seemed as if they were all under a spell there should be an excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years 
once in new york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine they had all been laughing joking when suddenly the engine had failed 
hed landed the plane on a small airstrip in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent 
now at this moment there should be none unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe the same tautnerved relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat 
silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet behind her nick trailing behind him she threw back a cushion over one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand 
she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion  and the deadliest poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness 
nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon  its quite possible theres more than codfish down there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held the harness for elaine 
poet nodded to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion another moment and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts 
they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back 
there was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean next to the ocean probably the loneliest spot was the desert 
yet alfredo wanted money wanted money to roam through the deserts and graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las vegas 
two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham had been snooping around the san luis rey mission the small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised up to watch it heading south 
a couple couldnt even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them if the character flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday he would have had an eyeful 
behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small groundswell a lone fisherman in the chair aft the fisherman was right in the middle of the deep 
someday geologists had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers 
why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip he couldnt skindive he couldnt run a boat except on the open sea 
strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom turning on the hifi he went back to the cockpit stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music 
he sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead 
pulling off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water  which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile she added as she swung her legs over the transom 
elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded his feet still hung over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in 
his forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat the word hissed distinctly from poets lips as he struggled to his feet 
his face was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm turning quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked surprise 
she had caught the implication of the oath her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely motionless 
elaine recovered first so quickly that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction  do you need a bandage 
 hurts like hell for a second then it disappears but her walk was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear 
at the same instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine 
the moment the sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage 
poet was the captured arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying to escape poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water 
poet twisted again and nicks knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping off the skin for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poets slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop him holding him now from the rear 
suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not sinking a sharp pain lanced across nicks chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising into the sky 
desperately nick flashed one hand up catching poets neck in the bend of his elbow at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece 
at once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden wild exultation as if this was a signal poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water 
harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam its a rich village but not much for action too many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs 
chief bob moore looked his same hickself a man mountain running to lard in his middleage 
hardly expected the head of county homicide up for this murder rookie investigator last summer and now its inspector jed 
his sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth  i guess it helps i said paying no attention to his ribbing 
youre not only young but well you dont even look like a police officer a runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut hell youd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set 
man when my ### pounds and sixfour comes along why its the same as another badge when i say move a guy moves 
also its far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come youve had your gassy lecture lets get to work who was the murdered woman mrs buck 
i know the killer have the only road off the peninsula covered  yeah passed your road block as i drove in i said sitting on his polished desk 
 about nine this morning mrs buck phones me shes having trouble with one of her farm hands money trouble colored fellow named tim williams only hand she has working for her now 
never had no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around to get a full weeks work  come on inspector look alive 
 julia asks me to come out at once but she didnt sound real alarmed you know like there was any immediate danger 
i would have come sooner if id known no doubt about tim being the killer i have a witness 
 yeah seems you have a nice package with all the strings tied  julia had has an old indian woman cooking for her nellie harris 
nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room swears she recognized his voice that tim yelled its my money and i want it 
and before you say it nellie aint near strong enough to have strangled julia theres no doubt this tim sneaked back and killed mrs buck 
but theres no way off the point except through my road block guess you want to see the body have her up the street in doc abels office 
being the harbors sole doctor abel was also its medical examiner the corpse was on a table covered by a sheet 
pulling back the sheet i examined the bruises around julia bucks once slender throat chief moore shook his big head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body 
i dropped the sheet glanced at my watch it was almost one and i hadnt had lunch 
i told him i want to go see the buck house walking back down main street i said i saw the harbors one squad car at the road block well ride out in my car 
as i slid in beside him he said some heap hey got a heck of a buy on this dirt cheap 
five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical twostory house and when the jaguar stopped i managed to swallow there was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes 
the fins of a caddy were sticking out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture nellie harris wasnt old she was ancient a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune 
she calmly repeated what moore had told me when i asked why didnt you go into the living room to see how mrs buck was 
i went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom way i always do in the morning  have you any idea what this tim and mrs buck were arguing about 
years ago when i asked her to put me in social security sos i wouldnt have to be working now miss julia threatened to fire me all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her  did you hear tim return 
 mrs buck have any men friends the wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth 
 was she on friendly terms with other members of her family  didnt have no family around here 
there didnt seem to be any signs of a struggle i told moore where does tims wife live 
we did ## miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks in late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these 
mrs tim williams was about ## with skin the color of bitter chocolate and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers she was startlingly pretty the inside of their place was full of new furniture five bucks down and a buck a week stuff but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home 
 did mrs buck owe him any wages  well for this week but they wasnt due till saturday 
tim is a good man hard working he strong as a bull but gentle as a baby 
he never in his life took a hand to a woman or  well get him soon see what he says chief moore cut in 
i asked a silly question youve no idea where your husband could be now i stood there staring at her for a moment thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty 
on my way out i told her if you should eh just happen to see your husband get him to give himself up hiding out like this wont get him anything except more trouble or a bullet 
we made it back to the harbor in less than four minutes i told moore i was going to eat get some forms filled out by doc abel 
i had a bowl of decent chowder phoned the doc and he said hed leave the death statements with his girl in a half hour lighting my pipe i took a walk 
even now there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock an oceangoing yawl anchored inside the breakwater there was a ## foot wheeler with chief bobs in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock 
i asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was moores bob moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing 
as i was walking back to the police station which was in the same building with the city hall and post office i saw mrs tim williams sneaking into the back of my car if she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it 
i drove out of the harbor turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped i waited a few minutes and she sat up 
she mumbled i just know that chief moore is out to kill my tim i never saw him so anxious before i said lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette 
you know where tim is dont you mrs williams she puffed on the cigarette slowly sitting slumped against the back seat 
take the same train diana beauclerk took and get there at the same time go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite #### 
besides the number of the suite hasnt been published in any newspaper to the hotel people youll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite 
once inside keep your eyes open  the police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a finetooth comb 
ten to one its even been redecorated  theres always a chance they may have overlooked something returned the chief 
try to imagine youre going to be murdered yourself between eleven pm and one am the night you arrive  cheerful way to spend an evening 
 suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime  that is exactly what im hoping for 
and the key to the suite is still missing on the train alec refreshed his memory of the beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies spotnews stories about the crime sent out by the pearson city star a member of the syndicate press 
two weeks ago she had gone west to pearson city daniel forbes her divorced husband lived there 
she reached pearson city at nine pm and went straight to the hotel westmore she telephoned the junior partner of her law firm martin stacy and asked him to call at her hotel that evening 
according to stacy she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask forbes for the lump sum stacy replied that it would bankrupt forbes who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture 
she was in good health and spirits but still determined to get the money from forbes no other visitor inquired for her that evening 
according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am her door was locked and the key was missing 
find a motive for stacy or an opportunity for forbes and the case would be solved the hotel westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in pearson city and definitely secondrate 
he studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary  id like the room i had the last time 
 do you recall the number alecs glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk 
 we have better rooms vacant now he babbled alecs face was dark blunt and sulky 
 anything wrong with the plumbing in #### there was a sudden stillness in the lobby 
a man lighting a match for his cigar paused until the flame burned his fingers even the bellboys on their bench were listening 
 its just that well #### is being redecorated alec leaned on the desk holding the clerks eyes with his 
 there might be a story in it  im with the syndicated press feature service 
it was blackmail and the clerk knew it  there is no story he piped tremulously 
he wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly the corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet 
at the end of the corridor alec noticed a door marked fire stairs the bellboy unlocked a white door numbered #### 
a few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow languid as falling feathers hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light 
deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new 
the mirror over the bureau was a blank eye round and innocent alec played the part of an innocent tourist 
 afraid youll lose your job if you dont keep your mouth shut if you want my advice pack up and take the next train back to new york 
but i wouldnt spend a night in here for a million bucks he was in a hurry to get out of the room 
there were three one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and one to the room next door which was immovable locked or bolted on the other side alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table 
not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room but white women didnt use white face powder nowadays he recalled 
blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands it seemed clean now but alec decided against a bath 
in the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window it winked as steadily as a metronome on off on off 
there was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall he lay still listening to the silence watching the light 
according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest 
a monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared 
it stretched to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling that meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light in this case the window 
someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window abandoning caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch 
there was a thick squashy crack of fist on flesh he put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be 
something heavy shook the floor as it dropped the blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room 
he had a short heavy powerful body alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face with narrow slanting eyes a primitive tartar face from russia or the balkans 
there was a slight bulge under the left armpit a shoulder holster he had seen it in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts 
diana beauclerk had no connection with the underworld a professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a
 what are you doing here his lips were bruised and swollen where alec had hit him 
alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response at all  oh come on snap out of it 
the man opened his mouth but no words came only that curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight 
in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver and handley walker to murder and sudden death but you realize i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if i tell you first of the old ones 
 sister said he do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven and she answered i dont know but i hope youll never do such a thing 
he said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny days swamp what has this to do with the present 
they had learned both of them about abraham wharf thats why i beg you not to forget him 
and i knew they knew it for id told them a lot of it and isnt it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows 
they are set forth in your own newspapers you want from me the story but a story is about why and then perhaps about how 
there is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture look at that mahogany highboy behind you which has a provocative emanation if i may say so places too have their haunting qualities 
when you hold the spirit of a thing then somehow you know the truth you know a fake antique from the real thing and the truth is what youve come for is it not 
in fact all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like others there were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family 
after that he was never known to run or even walk fast today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england that i know of 
but now its the most lost and tortured place in the world those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraines stony character 
its perhaps a mile from here where we sit and not one single dwelling left there though once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred houses 
 even i can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man it is now a sweep of boulders and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows 
both red mciver and handley walker lived nearby almost as near as i do red lived at lanesville and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hours brisk walk 
id often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching they were both painters they were 
searoad railroad lack of water killed dogtown dead dead as a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for im about the last to be even interested 
theyd come separately to gloucester some twenty years ago theres always been an artists colony somewhere on cape ann and each married here they married cousins anta and freya norberg 
pretty girls among them with blonde hair and pert faces handley married freya and red of the red beard married anta 
the quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it oh yes im quite sure its important because of the beech pasture 
you see besides being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar no i dont hold with those who live entirely among dead things 
as i was saying ive known all about the old records including the old norberg deed some ten years ago that page was torn out i dont know by whom 
he was courteous and casual about it as though it were of no consequence hes always like that in spite of being a big man 
 a sensual man but very courteous some would say slick too many outside manners to my taste 
a real gentleman i feel would do neither hes always worn a broadbrimmed hat and ive noticed in my small study at the society that he rather smells of cosmetics 
red was small and fineboned like ivoryinlay he too asked to see the same page 
 by god its that damn handley the sneak and later in the same week they both came together to examine the register 
red thrusting out his tawny beard handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair red always was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the two 
during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from the accusations each hurled at the other theres a fine granite quarry there and granites coming back for public buildings 
fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will had said it began with a preamble of course 
after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges to the well and bakeoven and to one third of the cellar i can show you the cellar when we go up also one cow right and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower namely the beech pasture and i remember that the whole of the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty pounds 
that battle scene ridiculous as it was remained in my mind a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day i saw handley escorting anta reds wife up on dogtown common 
not that i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high and i am a small woman one other cause of jealousy between them i must tell you 
if red had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in rockport you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence 
i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the designs of destiny yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday 
not much to shoot but there are a few pheasant rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk around here havent the sense to appreciate 
that was the day red was said to have gone away oh yes hed talked about doing so 
anta his wife never seemed to mind i suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin handley 
no he didnt have his gun which he should have it would have been a good excuse for his being there at all 
haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tearfilled eyes he had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing 
but his newfound buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the mans eyes were still clear the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes 
he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger but of course he remembered now 
the stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have been hit if phil hadnt called out to him a second before 
as a matter of fact he wouldnt have cared at all if the guy had been hit actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them 
so the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safedriving record then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck drivers face without saying a word 
haney hadnt given it much thought at the time now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off 
when the light went their way they went on across the street and when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them 
but he decided he wouldnt mind company in return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company 
when he finally got the coughing under control he realized that pete all he gave was his first name was still waiting for an answer he didnt even seem to wink as he continued to stare  guess i cant think of anyone pete 
 i think you arent taking me seriously phil i might have got hit by that truck if it wasnt for you 
maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit he really didnt expect anything to come of it and there were a few people
he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio and sing while im taking a bath he says the neighbors complain but i dont believe it 
when he looked up again he seemed almost contented i want to study your landlords habits and movements first 
in that way theres no trouble for the customer  its my line of work he said
haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table 
the next day sunday the hangover reminded haney where he had been the night before the hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groaned 
of course on thursday haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger could do something about hercoming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building 
his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection 
haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks he muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator 
after a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions but after all why should they 
the stranger really had nothing to do with it of coursehaney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord 
really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor so you thought i didnt mean what i said 
it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare however haney knew it was not a dream 
it was the same bar and it was two weeks later saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual he had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any talkative friendly lushes 
in fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the tabletop with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone 
he hadnt even noticed what was his name the man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow 
he began to wish that he hadnt shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a barbuddy 
in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice 
haney didnt want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble the guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by haneys lack of appreciation 
in time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes when he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke in 
 that bitch would love a divorce he growled  then shed get half of everything i have 
you must understand i havent been in this state too long thats why i why i do a free job now and then 
haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain 
a retired professional killer if he was just a nut no harm was done but if he was the real thing he could do something about lolly 
 no offense intended he said gently  but its just that well you know 
after all i didnt know you pete  but if you say you managed it the stranger was hooked 
 of course it looked like an accident i always work it that way and always at a time when the customer has an alibi 
haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through 
i went through and down into pitch darkness ill pull the boards back and then get us a light 
a moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle and i could see it was a big room empty except for a few things of popss at the far end a wooden crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled bindle 
hed hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through i took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket 
 listen i got a buddy i travel with real nice guy named larry i know where he is right near here 
well both be blowing town tomorrow so we wont be moving in on you he hesitated a second looking at the bottle before he said suresure and i reassured him 
you can work on this one while im gone kill it if you want i took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him 
 git over by the window while theres light an ill put th candle out when yuh come back ill put it out agin till youre both inside 
 perfect setup i told him  but we got to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two 
on the way i gave him the scoop i bought another pint of sherry and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again 
there was still a little not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it and charlie opened his i was reminded amusedly by a poem of kenneth patchens called the murder of two men by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background 
and a blaring final chord from the jazz group this was the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves 
pops was taking long ones but not showing the effect yet he seemed as drunk as when id first talked to him but no drunker 
about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now i said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final drink 
there was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise and hed never known what hit him hed never known that anything had hit him 
 and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit but as an order so i stopped my hand and looked at him he was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me 
to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether hes dead or not 
i dug him i saw his point i took the piece of pipe from charlies hand and used it harder than he had 
all right now ill give you a hand we straightened pops up and i made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat 
it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes but lets not talk about it abstractly until were out of here 
 if we left one wed have to wipe it for fingerprints heres the picture we want to leave for the fuzz whenever the body gets found 
if theyd been working on a bottle or a jug hed have taken it with him and hed have taken the weapon with him too so we take that 
same goes for the rough cement of the ledge besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting 
 we cant take a chance on that weve got to assume theyll decide he was murdered and weve got to keep the picture consistent 
we did that and found a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change we took the matches they were book matches and once theyd been touched might retain fingerprints and the change 
the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldnt set fire to the crate when it guttered out a fire wouldnt have mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner 
we went once more over every point then triplechecked being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger and we werent picked up by a cop 
winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour which if it matters was one am 
almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told myself that was ridiculous thinking like that can get you into a padded pad 
we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow also our plans for me to commit charlies murder and for him to commit mine 
we planned ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes id tell him everything id learned about seatons habits and habitat and hed tell me the score on radic 
charlie would get there early because he had the key from here on in the less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one anothers rooms the better 
we met at maxines and decided we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the evening to talk things out charlie had brought food and wed decided on no drinks 
i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and his house and domestic arrangements he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down 
hed been there several times back when while he and radic had been friends or at least not enemies it didnt take us as long as wed thought it might 
shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first or would you rather deal a hand of showdown poker or play a game of gin rummy or what 
 one thing we havent discussed expense money well need some at least if only bus fare to the scene of the crime 
ive got a little stashed for a rainy day and i guess this is rainy enough if you draw the short straw ill lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take off to visit my sister in frisco 
i took a deep breath and the plunge  in that case lets not draw 
so it wouldnt be for days or even a week before you could do anything but your friend manny can go any time 
 i was hoping youd say that willy well in that case i take off tomorrow morning for frisco 
the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted 
 only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration 
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes  this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money 
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said  failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers 
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee  these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said 
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable on other matters the jury recommended that # 
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the #### governors race a top official said wednesday robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience 
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended

 committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation 
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce ## million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of ## million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug ## 
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer 
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers  if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said 
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin 
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday  senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties 
there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of ###### or more population require deaf children between # and ## years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here

rep berry an exgambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later

the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements ## a separate trial 
 the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court  some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property 
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this  yes your honor replied bellows 
there is a conflict among the defendants  president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio

the last ## cases in the investigation of the nov # election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the ## persons 
karns ruling pertained to eight of the ## cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case 
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about ### persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the ##th precinct of the ##d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation 
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes 
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving ## persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another 
the case of the judges in the ##th precinct of the ##d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns after reading his statement discharging the ##d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them 
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build ## new medical and ## new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill 
the social security payroll tax is now # per cent # per cent on each worker and employer on the first $#### of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $#### a year and the payroll tax to ## per cent ### per cent each 
the payroll tax would actually rise to ## per cent starting jan # #### if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by # per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to ## billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run # billion or more in the first year #### 
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of ### million to # billion dollars over the next ## years these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes 
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to ## days for each illness except that the patient would pay $## a day of the cost for the first nine days full payment of nursing home bills for up to ### days following discharge from a hospital 
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $## a patient community visiting nurse services at home for up to ### days an illness 
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay  this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals 
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed every person will choose his own doctor and hospital 
apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools the president said the nations ## medical and ## dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care 
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $#### a year for onefourth of the first year students the schools could use the money to pay #year scholarships based on need of up to $#### a year per student 
officials estimated the combined programs would cost ## million dollars the first year and would go up to ## millions by #### the president recommended federal matching grants totaling ### million dollars in ## years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones 
he asked for another ## million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals 
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation 
the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the ### million dollars in the ###### budget for direct government research in medicine the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them 
legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message 
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house 
only ## senators were on the floor and there was no record vote a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard 
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a ## hour delay after they are reported to the floor the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in #### and president kennedys in #### 
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems 
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension 
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive 
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive 
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots 
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole 
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come 
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos 
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated 
the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make 
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises 
former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory 
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score 
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination 
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations 
mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated 
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements 
but thus far there has been no response in kind foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations 
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate 
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos 
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army 
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation 
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem 
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since #### each year showing an increase in offenders among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in #### about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under ## years of age 
mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time east providence now has no civil defense program 
he is not interested in being named a fulltime director noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director 
mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said 
one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said 
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack 
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack 
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid 
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly 
mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july ## and sent to the state house by miss grant the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature 
he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said  i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws 
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation 
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday 
the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government 
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labormanagement expert said here yesterday 
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in #### 
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track 
he said that when he was a socialist in #### the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties 
he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his #### philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own 
a petition bearing the signatures of more than #### johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr 
mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within ## days he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within ## days after the board of canvassers completes its work 
mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures 
mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july ## to plan further strategy in the charter movement he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes 
 it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than ## members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission 
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter 
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system 
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective 
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense 
mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before ### persons at the park hotel the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club 
hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired now hes gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state 
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign  how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this 
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president 
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary 
state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate must share the blame for this 
 but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell 
 he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you cant have it both ways jones said the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue 
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations  i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste 
it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit sen charles w sandman rcape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination 
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway 
 we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington  we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year 
mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman county supervisor weldon r sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them

but well have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson 
he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead 
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry  we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said 
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november hughes supported gov meyners green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development 
the plan will provide $## million for purchase of open land by the state the other $## million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis 
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved 
 after the primary he promised ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee

at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years 
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept # democratic primary 
their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader 
he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation 
in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this years ticket but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor 
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterdays new york times

 thousands of bleachertype seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan ## assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f kennedy and retiring president dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oathtaking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route 
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it within view of the avenue are some of the united states governments tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments 
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about sevenstories high great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about ### years old 
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote in the #### presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time 
also the department of justice building is located where j edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground 
in this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least ## marching units 
division one of the parade will be the service academies division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas the respective states of the president and of vicepresident l b johnson 
division three will be headed by the marines followed by ## states division four will be headed by the navy followed by ## states 
division six will be headed by the coast guard followed by the reserve forces of all services five states puerto rico the virgin islands guam american samoa the trust territories and the canal zone  what does #### offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi 
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants gov ross barnett barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well 
some predict the administration will settle down during #### and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office 
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the #### legislative session if barnett doesnt call a special session in #### it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session 
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the $#### per diem is not certain and if they start agitating barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure 
with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during #### with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house 
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary 
now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen 
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government 
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation 
the administration could not say why $## million was needed for a grantinaid program the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote 
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration 
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration 
they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition 
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $## million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $## million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one 
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year 
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in #### to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser 
it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature 
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves

a ###pound #foot #inch senior from stamford moritz practices nothing but placekicking last year when he worked out at halfback all season he didnt get into a single game 
 so i started practicing on it in spring training moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough 
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson ## in a #### district game  i kicked about ### extra points in ### tries during three years in high school he said and made ## in a row at one time

he went into the army in march #### and returned two years later but he was scholastically ineligible in #### and merely present last season 
 once you get the feel of it theres not much to it ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel

 he almost brought it back all the way except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice 
 hell be out of action all this week he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game 
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland  hes looking a lot better and hes able to run meek explained

 in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only ## passes 
 they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off

jim landis ###foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a ## lead but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard al smiths ###blast over left in the fourth his fourth homer of the campaign tied the score and carreons first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front 
ogden utah may # ap  boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball 
 i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any ##th man on the ball club this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout 
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno nev where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited she said when she learned jackie was heading home im just speculating but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances 
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him the conductor said to ritchie i dont think you want to talk to him 
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand  i told him who i was and he was quite cold 
he said he had never talked to liston liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying 
and so it was over the weekend what with ##yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying #homer spree sunday both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime 
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the #scoreyear milestone and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was ## and a topgrade big leaguer 
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al 
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct ## #### before a new record crowd for the period of #####  spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another allout guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse 
incidentally only two did it before a home audience bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field 
willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee 
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as ## home runs and stole as many as ## bases willies lifetime batting average of is ## points beyond mickeys 
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home 
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy 
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level 
this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game  the powerful new york yankees won their ##th world series in a #game romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating ### barrage monday in the loosely played finale 
johnny blanchard mantles replacement slammed a #run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a #run first inning hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a #run homer off bill henry during another #run explosion in the fourth 
the crowd of ##### had only two chances to applaud in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about ### feet away with two men on 
in the fifth wally post slashed a #run homer off bud daley but by that time the score was ### and it really didnt matter the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager 
 nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between $##### and $##### a year 
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff jerry williams and charlie gauer skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry 
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing 
skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack split between running and passing skorich who is ## years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers 
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in #### he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy n y 
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers the eagles signed him for shaws staff in #### 
shaw and skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football with the announcement of a special achievement award to william a bill shea the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday nights thirtyeighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter baseball writers association of america at the waldorfastoria hotel 
frank graham the journalamerican sports columnist bill mazeroski the world series hero of the pittsburgh pirates and casey stengel the former manager of the yankees 
mazeroski whose homer beat the yankees in the final series game will receive the babe ruth award as the outstanding player in the #### world series graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the william j slocum memorial award 
a crowd of #### is expected for the ceremonies which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit dance and song the ##yearold shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york 
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees 
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another national league club to move here when that failed he enlisted branch rickeys aid in the formation of a third major league the continental with new york as the key franchise 
the new york franchise is headed by mrs charles shipman payson a bigleague municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c frick

all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday on friday roger maris the yankee outfielder and winner of the american leagues mostvaluableplayer award will meet with roy hamey the general manager 
arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre 
deane beman the national amateur champion and all the metropolitan district champions including bob gardner the amateur titleholder also will receive awards the writers gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield n j and palm beach fla for his sponsorship of charity tournaments 
the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington democrat of missouri arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months 
he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the $##### diamondstudded hickok belt but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot 
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all 
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all the worlds best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher 
on the narrow fairway of a ###yard hole arnold whipped into his second shot the ball went off in a majestic arc an outofbounds slice 
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side  it is possible that i overcorrected he said ruefully 
 it was a nice round figure that ## he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an ## in the texas open 
their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully willies partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count 
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project  nae man said willie ye must be countin the echoes 
if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book this knowledge has come in handy too 
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association 
 i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings 
thats how he first won the masters in #### it happened on the twelfth hole a ###yarder 
 i can remove the ball cant i  you must play it where it lies 
 ill do as you say but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling he scored a # for the embedded ball a # with the provisional one 
until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers but after that ## at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before 
other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional footballs hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments the owners would like each club in the fourteenteam league to play a homeandhome series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division

with a lefthander going for pittsburgh i may use don taussig in center  lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about ## minutes and he looked good hemus said 
our pitching is much better than it has shown the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday 
despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess gino cimoli bill virdon bob clemente and dick groat eachbill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet

speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who in the words of coach john benington had more confidence in themselves than i did the most valuable player award was split three ways among glen mankowski gordon hartweger and tom kieffer 
 you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability 
 several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say dont worry coach well get em all right 
kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his allround excellent play mankowski the ballhawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis us nationally televised victory 
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills after the coach listed all the boys faults hartweger said coach before i leave here youll get to like me 
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said i want to thank coachs wife for talking him into letting me play bob burnes sports editor of the globedemocrat presented bob nordmann with his award 
within a week after the injury suffered in st louiss victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament nordmann was sitting on the bills bench doing what he could to help benington on the clock given him was the inscription for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball ###### 
 this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future benington pointed out  by winning against bradley kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesnt take a super team to do it 
larry scherer last night pitched a nohit game said to be the first in billiken baseball history as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college ## at crystal city the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie 
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double len boehmer also was #for# with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at # against washington university at ligget field 
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at ### tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy ill saturday if its true that contented cows give more milk why shouldnt happy ball players produce more base hits 
and thats meant as a boost not a knock mays and mantle both ##year men at ## have so much ability that baseball men agree theyve never hit the heights 
like the yankees slugger mays the terror of the giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by or for willie his best years were #### when he hit with ## homers and ## when he belted ## home runs drove in ### and stole ## bases 
yes we know theyre professionals men paid to play and they shouldnt care how theyre handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month the truth is though that men react differently to different treatment 
mantle its apparent resented casey stengels attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility stengel inherited dimaggio rizzuto but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors from joplin to new york 
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats inheriting a more mature mantle who now has seen the sights on and off broadway ralph houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on mickey 
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far the opinion continues here that with a ###game schedule pitching spread thin through a ##team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books babe ruths ## homers of #### 
willies wonderful walloping sunday four home runs served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark next to leo durocher dark taught mays the most when he was a grassgreen rookie rushed up to the polo grounds ## years ago this month to help the giants win a dramatic pennant

 greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $######## to greek victims of nazi persecution it was announced today probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week 
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell 
in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than ### shares some dallas investment firms got only ### shares for all of their customers 
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $#### a share the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler guerin & turner the managing underwriter was at $## a share 
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up 
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering  we subscribe ### shares of morton foods of texas 
after it allotted shares to ## underwriters and ## selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation 
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one 
first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up as a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced at roughly ## times #### earnings to yield a little over # per cent on the ##cent anticipated dividend 
both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late 
the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days 
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito 
now if mortons newest product a corn chip known as chipos turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to dallas and north texas is known worldwide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the millions of dollars

 the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn beryl w sprinkel economist of harris trust & savings bank chicago predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn california group conference another speaker william h draper jr former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper gaither & anderson urged the us to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we wont be pushed around any more 
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern  in view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in #### nor as severe as in late #### and #### 
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in ###### as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation 
the unsatisfactory ###### expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike draper declared as i see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today 
he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration that russia respects our show of strength but that presently were not acting as we should and must he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do

i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school 
now they go to a high school that is two miles away one might think the problem would be similar 
generally they go to school with a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails a certain loss of social status 
 why dont you walk to school then  my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois 
i explained however that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom i had to ride a streetcar two miles 
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then 
she has to have at least one car herself i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman 
they say that when they take a car gloriana doesnt take her car but rides with them but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isnt big enough 
the solution naturally is the bus however its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and its too hard on my legs

make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base 
if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your childs whims although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a childs playtime 
todays trend toward furniture designs from americas past is teaching homeowners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions

when he attended the christian anticommunist crusade school here about six months ago jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it the best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church 
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than ### top teenagers and ## adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation 
and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days by ted place director of greater miami youth for christ and jon braun director of campus crusade for christ the second half of the film communism on the map and the movie operation abolition also will be shown

pianists leon fleisher ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray the leningrad kirov ballet which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house is i think the finest classical ballet company i have ever seen and the production of the petipatschaikowsky sleeping beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing 
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people 
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya 
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests miss omsk miss pinsk miss stalingr oops skip it these qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this companys collective personality 
ohthepainofit that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety is totally absent from the kirov this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics 
irina kolpakova the princess aurora of fridays performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable 
vladilen semenov a fine danseur noble konstantin shatilov a great character dancer 
the production designed by simon virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way it was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted pastellike style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery

for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies after all this years movies are next years television shows 
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film 
after television la dolce vita seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week 
week in week out there is more sex to be seen in the adventures of ozzie and harriet there is more decadence on ## sunset strip 
in another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater 
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip 
a frigid beauty and three silly fairies put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of dull 
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining as a moral shocker it is a dud 
the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly  this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories

the gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey whose famous estate tranquility was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover n j authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set ### years ago

the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem mass an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in #### the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace 
the aid committees chairman in charge of the redecoration mrs henry francis lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project mrs lenygons committee associates announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel both wellknown manhattan decorators 
president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the ##minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the ##piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard n c but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music 
it was the first in the series of concerts for young people by young people to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house she was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience 
as he approached the open bandstand erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion the band struck up the star spangled banner and followed it with hail to the chief  i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band and we are grateful to them president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl 
he added i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field displaying his knowledge of music the new englandborn president remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont by young americans and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the united states 
as he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests he expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde patricia holbrook ## of mount rainier had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston 
patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon 
many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected 
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary letitia baldrige told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring he said he contacted a friend henry hall wilson on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series 
one of the most interested students on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house was letitia baldrige social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy  i was an art major in college miss baldrige explained 
she turned out to be a fan too of margaret bouton the gallerys associate curator of education miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at # pm 
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later they decided that they thought rembrandts selfportrait made him look sad 
everybody had heard of van gogh the french impressionist gallery director john walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them 
im sure youve heard of him and his record the confederacy along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards

the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous 
hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often that he didnt help around the house and that he didnt really care about the family he in turn told her she demanded too much 
without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer 
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up mr and mrs black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia the agency nearest them 
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other they are now working together toward solving their difficulties 
mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the childrens bedtime is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family roughhousing to outsiders the blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are but with a difference 
family service has helped hundreds of families in this area perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital 
family service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze 
 im hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable 
now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers merge without let selfs integrity was and is and ever had been 
there was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster tabernacle not just cusp when he and digby had come face to face alone why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing jubals conversations coming and going jubals words troubled him most 
the word church which turned up over and over again among jubals words gave him knotty difficulty there was no martian concept to match it unless one took church and worship and god and congregation and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growingwaiting then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which had been rejected by each differently by jubal by mahmoud by digby 
in his mind he spoke simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana 
now he felt light and gay and clearheaded ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet 
ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed mike felt disappointed that mahmoud had left 
 come on theres some cold chicken and well see what else they went downstairs loaded a tray lavishly 
 warm enough to swim real indian summer jubal said that his nightsight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it 
as for the night being warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of it 
in the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother mike liked having light up through the ripples 
what are they doing on mars the question was too wide for the sparse english language 
 taught to grow but my people martians i mean 
in the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the summer are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing  of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated and the others are sad 
mr booker t w jones food technician first class is not sad he had his own face dark and beautiful 
he rolled toward her and took her in his arms i grok i shall never be lonely again 
that was almost worse than the first time  you are all right my brother 
is that i mean do you know  well ive been ready a long time goodness we all have but never mind dear 
then as their grokking made them ever closer and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back oh on mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship 
part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a longdistance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations the old ones neither helped nor hindered this plan

a funeral parlor chain was indicted for pricecutting fosterite bishops after secret conclave announced the churchs second major miracle supreme bishop digby had been translated bodily to heaven and spotpromoted to archangel ranking withbutafter archangel foster 
lunita and hoy published identical denunciations of shorts elevation losservatore romano and the christian science monitor ignored it times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian simply reported it the fosterites in england were few but extremely militant the man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished and that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up 
you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me now that short is supreme bishop hell do all right he cant help it 
check with one of them go ahead theres no professional jealousy here digby calmed down but made one request 
but im telling you itll be turned down you dont understand the system yet the martians have their own setup different from ours and as long as they need him we cant touch him 
 you mean this punk can brush me aside and ive got to hold still for it  i held still for the same thing didnt i 
now look theres work to be done and lots of it if you need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and take it 
the sooner you act like an angel the quicker youll feel angelic jubal did not hear of digbys disappearance when it was announced and when he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it 
jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom and didnt want to inquire mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches 
jubal couldnt reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting abc vs d then bcd vs a or ab vs cd or ad vs cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each other this continued most of the week following that illstarred trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before 
the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied to cook much less be secretaries even rocksteady anne hell anne was the worst 
however we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago 
 but the third ship came back several years ago and reported  that it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings 
macneff stopped pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes  forgive me sandalphon said hal 
i believe it was on page ### macneff smiled and said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression 
i still bear scars on my back where pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough he was a good impresser that pornsen 
he was the dormitory gapt when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him he is the one responsible for my getting such low m rs 
no not he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does 
so forgive me sigmen for the contrarytoreality thoughts  please pardon me again sandalphon said hal 
perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner himself  though that does not mean that there may not be such records there 
i cant tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere if you volunteer you will be told where youre going after the ship leaves 
we have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion hal waited macneff paced some more frowning 
 a thousand pardons said hal  but i have just thought of one thing 
 there will be no women aboard the gabriel and if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce 
macneff raised his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce 
naturally he couched the provision in obscure language in his great and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned 
it was night on this hemisphere but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia hal the linguist saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein 
southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar his mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south of the sahara sea 
in southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandicspeaking peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called march this was no mans land disputed by the haijac union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred years 
so for all practical purposes it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government unrecognized outside its own borders its citizens spoke all of the worlds surviving tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper 
here the peoples spoke the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiianamericans who were busy resettling north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war then there was north america where american was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of frenchcanadians living on the hudson bay preserve 
and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment but mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to tahiti 
her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically if hal yarrow had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way 
somehow all the other passengers also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel had simultaneously agreed to die and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony 
he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome yet he told himself this was the best way 
mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt 
hal doubted if this happy event would occur mary was as frozen below the navel as he 
he would no longer have to see that fat face hear that whining voiceand slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned 
 my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice  i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage 
 sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking  how wonderful to see your cherished self 
the gabriel pointed towards her destination and under onegee acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity ### percent of the speed of light meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the suspensor 
some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others they would sleep while the gabriels drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured 
many years later the photoncounting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied 
and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation these members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel 
hal yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo 
the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted 
his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly 
for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed somewhat from earthmens the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar 
another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different word 
the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses plus the fact that siddo not only had the normal to earthmen three genders of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual 
the system of indicating gender varied according to tense all the other parts of speech nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs 
no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to reexamine all his basic assumptions make valuejudgments on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives 
 or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack 
there was nothing he could do but wait  we misjudged you he said slowly 
of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center individually they are nearly as mortal as you the difference does not seem very marked to us where it exists 
we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half  for now it is clear that we were in the wrong 
 i did not perceive this essential distinction either firstborn hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal jack what is the nature of this concept 
 we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given his heart he discovered was pounding 
between individuals this process is called bargaining when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty 
recovering the property was much less important though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us 
but this one was not nearly as long  then it is a matter of pleasure 
but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older 
we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt 
jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it had vanished without a trace what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws 
the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing less than total trust and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war 
almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal 
out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations suspicion between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentiethcentury rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies 
the trouble with them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled suppose that this one were to work 
in fact it had to be tried it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed 
but there was no small way to handle this one he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips 
it seemed to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up 
 you cant see them yet jack theyll be in range in a short while 
no there was a tiny pip on the radar if that was the skiff it was making unprecedented speed 
through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it the sail was still unfurled though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted would be the case by now 
but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous cometstail of angels the skiff was not heading for the nursery however 
and there would be no chance of signaling them without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone fuming helpless he watched them pass him 
he would never have believed without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them 
the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldnt be argued with however the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angels life and religion 
it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off langer would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not 
but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud was a center of government instead of a center of life and faith 
if it was intentional it was now also unnecessary and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous 
when he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated he had to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have it fast 
 im going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do but i cant take you to earth yet 
will you obstruct this or will you help i know its not part of the bargain and your elders might not like it 
 as for my elders they have already admitted that they were wrong if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all 
without an instants transition the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board always before it had taken five minutes to 
but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept orbit  hesperus dont use this ttau vector trick of yours please 
he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw  ekstrohm nogol you guys okay 
he didnt say what would cure him he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself 
 well lets take a groundlevel look at the country around here a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss 
that cold empty sky was full of fire and light it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer 
these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did 
they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history  how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely 
 some can be lonely in a crowd nogol said elaborately  what will we need outside ryan 
 we can breathe out there all right this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago 
think theyre intelligent maybe hostile  i think theyre dead ekstrohm interjected quietly 
sonic electronic galvanic all blank according to these needles theyre stone dead 
 you hold down the fort nogol  i heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldnt get an encephalographic reading on him 
 im not worried about you misreading the dials nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all remember when the little hand is straight up thats negative 
ryan told him what he could do then ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall 
actually the types of infection that could attack a warmblooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories he wasnt likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever 
it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side 
 one of the best matches ive ever found still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world 
the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts  what shall we do with this one 
it sure as hell doesnt look like any dominant intelligent species to me of course thats not definite proof 
 i think wed better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent 
 but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures  the planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output 
maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and dont have any rs stored up they could take a lot without harm  then maybe it was the shockwave we set up 
 at this stage of the game anything could be possible but theres one possibility i particularly dont like 
suppose it is something right on the planet native to it i just hope it doesnt work on earthmen too 
there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being 
ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on yancey# ### there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground 
the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum 
he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor there was no longer any need to hide 
in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this 
others admitted he was absolutely correct he never slept his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons 
naturally he couldnt let his shipmates know this insomnia would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds 
since he couldnt sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain 
in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier but the secret itself was just as hard 
he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldnt seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style on impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble 
behind him his mates stirred without waking ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble 
the angry burntred face of ryan greeted him  okay stormy this isnt the place for fun and games 
all the dead animals laying around the ship  what are you talking about ryan 
all i know is that they are gone ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt 
 ill be damned ekstrohm said expe doesnt like anybody mucking up primary evidence 
 why pick me for your patsy this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon 
 listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt but you arent exactly the model of a surveyor you know 
 no ekstrohm said no i didnt know that  youve been hiding things from me and nogol every jump weve made with you 
 what could i do with your lousy dead bodies what would i want with them 
now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away it was not a new experience to ekstrohm 
i give you my word im not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition take my word cant you 
i outweigh you fifty pounds and im fast for a big man why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong 
she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big citys special nursery soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began 
instead of kicking feet helvas neural responses started her wheels instead of grabbing with hands she manipulated mechanical extensions 
for helva was destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half she would be among the elite of her kind 
as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there were no sideeffects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary normal being however no diagram of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn 
a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages 
and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the welloriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe 
not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the subconsciouslevel instruction 
one such group got all incensed over shelled children when helva was just turning fourteen when they were forced to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs 
most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous to them bodies were mercifully concealed helvas class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program 
her subject was large a copy of the last supper and her canvas small the head of a tiny screw she had tuned her sight to the proper degree 
shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths helvas hum then had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings 
helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface she instinctively regulated her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions 
 vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intrastellar distances and must be eliminated although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people she took this experience calmly 
 i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear the lady amended would you like to see my work 
 i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw  no i say the lady twittered 
 of course some of my color values do not match the old masters and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy the ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out 
if she could have blushed she would have  you people dont have adjustable vision 
 here this will help suggested helva substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw 
 are you referring sir asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin  if you substitute atom for angel the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the pin in question 
 did they remember to program a sense of humor as well young lady  we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect 
if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a morsel as well  singing as applicable to herself required research 
but singing for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis 
therefore to helva the problem that she couldnt open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not bother her she would work out a method bypassing her limitations whereby she could sing 
her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice 
for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells after experimentation helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone 
she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall 
it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased it was to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted 
shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship the aj 
the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and sealed her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the final delicatebeyonddescription brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings 
her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine 
she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned 
consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners had there been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have been guided to make the first move 
 hello anyone at home  of course replied helva logically activating her outside scanners 
 all you have to do is ask he retorted hopefully i thought perhaps there were no partners available and ive had no directives from central 
always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive 
it would have killed you in the cabin do you have anything for me 
mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm bdikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the supercondamine hit mercer 
he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them 
it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did the two women babbled and crooned at him 
with most of his mind he was happy he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this 
a painful stab hit him in the abdomen the drug went after the pain and swallowed it 
the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time he rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert that was a good bite 
said she im strong too we can die too we can die like real people 
with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything 
mercer wondered how long the supercondamine had lasted him he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement 
he watched his own body with remote casual interest the lady da and the handcovered woman stayed near him 
having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining 
the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain 
he remembered them well from his happy period formerly he had noticed them now he felt them 
she smiled at him with benign remote happiness apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body 
the halfman lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the halftransparent film which protected his abdominal cavity the halfman woke recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin 
did you ever see a play  you mean a game with cards 
 i never saw that said mercer but i  but you want to ask me when bdikkat is going to come back with the needle 
we all know what is going to happen we all know when it is going to happen 
but we never know how long a scene is going to take  whats a scene 
the halfman laughed with something close to real humor a scene is just a part of a play 
the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long im inclined to think that they are about two earthweeks each 
the halfman received a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly at mercer take it out you fool when mercer looked on helplessly the halfman twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself 
once again bdikkat moved among them like a father this time bdikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercers thigh a sleeping childs head covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes 
he saw the childface grimace as the head was cut he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain as bdikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately 
then there had been another head beside his own or was that after the torso and legs waist to toetips of the little girl which had grown from his side 
in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely woman but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and hope people never live forever 
thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived sometimes bdikkat took the new ones resting in the everlasting sleep of their burnedout brains in a groundtruck to be added to other herds 
finally mercer did manage to follow bdikkat to the door of the cabin he had to fight the bliss of supercondamine to do it 
fighting pleasure itself he begged bdikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there bdikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not come out of the doorway 
when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol  standard years eightyfour years seven months three days two hours eleven and one half minutes 
what persuaded the cowman to remain on shayol was bdikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded by a family of little cowpeople resembling himself 
he remembered the last time he had eaten actual eggs from an actual pan the dromozoa kept him alive but he did not know how they did it 
there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less the years if they were years went by 
those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men 
her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all 
though they saw the oldstyle chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond bdikkats cabin they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh far long ago some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter 
the letter scraped on stone had been a message home they could still read the opening once i was like you stepping out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in
